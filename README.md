<h1 align="center">Chatbot MVP with Rasa and React</h1>

<p align="justified">This project sets up a chatbot MVP using Rasa for the backend and React for the frontend. The chatbot can handle user interactions, collect lead information, and provide responses based on predefined intents and entities.</p>

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm

## Backend Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ritwik-28/chatbot-mvp.git
cd chatbot-mvp
```

### Step 2: Create Dockerfile for Environment Setup

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your repository. Refer to the code in the repository.

### Step 3: Create `docker-compose.yml`

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of your repository. Refer to the code in the repository.

### Step 4: Create `requirements.txt`

List all Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

### Step 5: Initialize Rasa Project

Initialize a new Rasa project:

```bash
rasa init --no-prompt
```

### Step 6: Update `nlu.yml`

Add intents and examples to `data/nlu.yml`. Refer to the code in the repository.

### Step 7: Update `domain.yml`

Define intents, entities, slots, responses, forms, and actions in `domain.yml`. Refer to the code in the repository.

### Step 8: Create Custom Actions

Create `actions.py` in the `actions` directory. Refer to the code in the repository.

## Frontend Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to Frontend Directory

```bash
cd frontend
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the React App

```bash
npm start
```

## Running the Chatbot

1. **Start Docker Compose**:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. **Interact with the Chatbot**:

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to interact with the chatbot.

## Importance of Weights & Biases (W&B)

Weights & Biases (W&B) is used for experiment tracking, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. In this project, W&B helps monitor the training process of the Rasa models, ensuring there is no overfitting or underfitting. It provides detailed insights into model performance and helps improve the model iteratively.

### How W&B is Integrated

1. **Initialization**: W&B is initialized in the `actions.py` file.
2. **Tracking**: W&B tracks the performance of the Rasa models during training and provides detailed logs and visualizations.
3. **Evaluation**: W&B helps evaluate the models and compare different versions to select the best performing model.

## Detailed Steps

### Backend

1. **Dockerfile**: Defines the environment setup for Rasa, including installation of required packages and running the Rasa server.

2. **docker-compose.yml**: Configures multiple services including Rasa, the action server, and Elasticsearch.

3. **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python dependencies for the project.

4. **rasa init**: Initializes a new Rasa project with default configurations and data.

5. **nlu.yml**: Contains training data for the NLU model, including intents and examples.

6. **domain.yml**: Defines the structure of the chatbot, including intents, entities, slots, responses, forms, and actions.

7. **actions.py**: Contains custom actions for the chatbot, including interaction with Elasticsearch and handling user profiles.

### Frontend

1. **package.json**: Lists all the dependencies for the React frontend.

2. **public/index.html**: The main HTML file for the React app.

3. **src/App.js**: The main React component.

4. **src/Chatbot.js**: The chatbot component handling user interactions and displaying messages.

5. **src/Chatbot.css**: The CSS file for styling the chatbot component.
