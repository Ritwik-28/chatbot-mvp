        "Containerized applications are “isolated”; in the sense that they do not bundle in a copy of the operating system. Instead, an open source runtime engine (such as the Docker runtime engine) is installed on the host’s operating system and becomes the conduit for containers to share an operating system with other containers on the same computing system.",

        "Can you access the terminal inside a container? Check this ",
        " for how to go about doing that. Keep in mind that to run a shell inside your container, your image should have a shell installed in the first place (add commands to your Dockerfile for adding a shell or use an image that already has one installed, like ubuntu).",
        "Do you know what happens behind the scenes when you create a container? Check out this video I made to learn more about ",
        ":",
        "You should have a Dockerfile that builds an image for your application.

        "GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.\nThese actions form the steps to a workflow. A workflow can be imagined as a fixed set of instructions (actions) that are run at some particular event occurrence. Github workflows play an important part when it comes to developing apps.\nTwo use cases for using workflows:",

        "There are multiple options for the choice of environment to deploy Kuberenetes on. You can choose one of the many cloud providers to host your cluster on their systems. You can also choose to host a single node (machine) cluster on your own machine.",
        "The pros for choosing an online platform:",
        "The cons:",
        "You should have a Kubernetes cluster set up and functioning. You can verify this situation by running the following command which checks for all resources deployed to the cluster in the ",
        " namespace.",
        "You can try the following command, with an example output shown:",
        "You have learnt about containers, understood why they are important and even built one for your app, so far. The containers ran on your local machine and utilised your system's resources. It is a good method for testing out your app and your Dockerfile but not an ideal way to deploy real applications. Some of the reasons for that are:",
        ": To make your app accessible to the outside world (your customers), you'll have to connect your container to a port that has external access. It requires knowledge of networking and a good amount of planning to execute, especially when you have multiple containers running different applications and have varied needs for communication. It would be better to have a service that standardizes exposing your apps to the public, while handling common tasks like ",
        ".",
        ": The application you're building should be accessible at all times, which means your computer must be running 24x7 to ensure a good service, but it is\nimpractical to keep your machine running throughout the day, every day.",
        ": What happens if our app becomes popular and we see a surge in client traffic?\nThe response times would be affected, and we would want to have a more powerful\nmachine or maybe multiple machines altogether depending on the situation.\nAgain, this is not possible, going by the current implementation.",
        "Going by the arguments above, you need an \"orchestration platform\" that can manage your containers across different machines (nodes), handle discovery of the different services (apps), configure the bulk of networking for you and allow you to observe and monitor for errors. These are some of the functions among the host of others that orchestration platforms support. One such, and the most popular among them, is Kubernetes.",
        "With this context, watch the following video to get a clearer picture of why Kubernetes comes into the picture and what it can do for you. Also, check out this ",
        " to gain an insight into what Kubernetes is and what it is not, as well as the following video -",
        "I'll link a few more videos in the ",
        " section that you can check out if you're unclear about the technology. Feel free to search for more resources and learn from multiple sites to get a hold on this notoriously complex subject.",
        "In the 'Requirements' section below, we'll be covering step by step, some important components of Kubernetes. The knowledge of them will help you explore more on your own and will keep from you getting intimidated by the jargon when you go ahead with building more complex applications on Kubernetes.",
        "Hopefully, by now you understand that Kubernetes makes deploying apps easy on distributed systems. There is a master and one or more workers. The master has a lot of components that allow Kubernetes to function. Among them is the ",

        "Make sure you know how to-",
        "Once Kubernetes is set up and you know what it is, you can get to the task of actually making your app run on the cluster. Using the knowledge from the previous step and combining it with the information in the steps listed below, create a running implementation of your application. Keep in mind that all interactions with the ",
        " will be handled by the ",

        " which requires a file to be supplied. What is this file? And how does it convey all the information that ",
        " needs to run your resources?",
        "You'll learn about the specification for the different Kubernetes objects, write one for your app and see your app running on the cluster.",
        "Up to this point, all you needed to run applications in containers was a Dockerfile and an image that you built on top of it. To run an app on Kubernetes, you need to define a configuration file for every object you wish to deploy. How is this file written and what information does it convey? Read the page ",
        " to learn extensively about writing specifications in YAML.",
        "You are familiar with running containers but the smallest units that can be deployed in Kubernetes are pods. Nothing to fret about, pods are just a group of closely related containers that share the same network (localhost). Learn more about Pods ",
        ". How do you deploy pods? It will be through applying a configuration file too, like all other objects.",
        "Write a YAML file for a Pod that has a container, running your application. Use the image that we pushed to Docker Hub before (in milestone 3).",
        "When running your container locally on docker, you could check the logs using the ",
        " command. How can we achieve a similar functionality in Kubernetes? Check out this ",
        " to find out. Verify that you can obtain the logs for your application and establish that your app runs as expected.",

        "You should now be running your app on Kubernetes.\nVerify that you can find your pod by using",
        "command. You have seen how you can take an application, containerize it using a Dockerfile, build an image for it, push it to a registry and then use the image for a container you run inside a Kubernetes cluster.

        "I recommend installing VSCode along with the Flutter and Dart plugins to start developing flutter-based apps.",
        "If you're using the Flutter framework for the first time, I'd suggest you to go online and get a basic idea of what Flutter is and how it works. It'll help you connect better with the work that you're going to be doing.",
        "We will set up the basic skeleton of the app first. If you are making a Flutter app for the first time, refer this ",
        ". After successfully setting up your new flutter project, we will now make two directories:",
        "The file structure for the completed app would be similar to the image below.",
        "We're also going to need a few flutter packages available at ",
        ". For which we need to add few dependencies in ",
        " file, which should then look like -",
        "After setting up the project, we'll set up the firestore project and make the skeleton database structure:",
        "If you're using firebase for the first time, I'd recommend you to check this ",
        " out.",
        "Make a clean structure of how your database should look like. Decide what all collections should be incorporated and then further decide the structure and fields of the documents in each collection. You should atleast have these discrete collections -",
        "we'll discuss more on how the documents in each collection should look like in the later sections.",
        "Once you've made the skeleton of the database, it's time to connect your database with the application. Check this ",
        " out for a detailed walk-through.",
        "Search for different basic flutter packages and start using them for your own testing purpose.",
        "An important thing to note while making the screens and using the variables that power your app, is state management.",
        "There are different options you can take to manage state in your application. I'll list a few of them below:",
        "The BLoC principle can be used to provide fast, reactive state management. The changes in variables are reflected almost instantly. Check widgets like stream builders etc.",
        "To handle asynchronous data, I'd recommend using widgets like futures and future builders. It however, requires some initial set-up and boilerplate code to get it running. Research articles on how to build reactive apps on Flutter and this might help you get started on it.",
        "You can transfer variables between different screens using their constructors. It is the easiest way to achieve state management.",
        "It however gets a bit complex with increasing state variables and might lead to complications, further into development.",
        " about good design practices. Learn how you can make your app more accessible and user friendly.",
        "Evaluate your choice of widgets to use; fancier ones are appealing but keep utility in mind while making the choice. Check ",
        " for some cool widgets.",
        "Start with making the Homescreen, which should look like the image below. Use ",
        " for many designing and development resources. That navigation bar can be made using the curved navigation bar package available at pub.dev. Location icon shows the current location of the device, check this ",
        " out for a detailed walk through. I recommend placing all the location service related code in a separate dart file in the functionalities directory.The horizontal scrollable list under \"Top stores nearby\" shows all the stores nearby. We'll later discuss how to query stores based on the current location.",
        "Build the discover page. It's a very basic page with a tab-bar in it, the categories which will show products of that particular category, and the Shops tab which will show the products of that particular shop. Showing products of a particular shop or catagory or both can be tackled with simple firestore queries.",
        "Build the Orders page, which again is a simple task. All you need to do is query the orders collection based on the user data, then display using a list view.",
        "Making a wishlist page. I'd recommend storing the wishlist data of a particular user in a separate field of the user document. Which can simply be a list of the product ids of all the products in the wishlist. Now you just have to show those products with simple querying in a way similar to the image below.",
        "Making the product listview page, which basically shows different query results of the products collection, like search query, shop specific query, section specific query, discount specific query etc.",
        "Product description page. Whenever we tap on a product from the query result, we are navigated to another page which displays the complete product description. Descriptions include the full size images, price, discount, sizes, variants etc. This also contains shop details which is offering that specific product.",
        "To build the cart page, I'd recommend the same to have a separate field in the user document (in users collection). This will have all the cart related information, like product ids of the products in the cart and  their quantities. The cart should look like the image below. The card layout can be achieved using the card widget and the stack widget (which gives that effect to the delete button on the top right).",
        "On tapping the place order in the cart, you should be navigated to the review cart page. This will give you a summary of your order, address details, payment details etc. Again basic querying from the firestore should do most of the work. Adding a new address or edit phone number will require you to update the user document.",
        "To implement features like \"Place Order\", basic CRUD functions can be used. Store the order data in the orders collection. Make sure to include fields like payment detailed, address, userId etc.",
        "When you open the application for the first time or after logging out you're taken to a login page. If you're a new user, you can choose to register. Further, complete its form validation and authentication error handling by enabling registration of users using email or Gmail through Firebase authentication. The login/register pages should look like these:",
        "After registration/login page, users should be redirected to the homepage. In case of error in any of the credentials, the appropriate error must be displayed.",
        "The following figure is what your user's document in firestore should look like (with respect to the parameters assigned to each user like name, address, wishlist, cart etc).",
        "At this point, the login/register pages must be made along with its error handling. Also the user must be redirected to the home screen page upon successful login. Check for all sorts of errors (email, password, password confirmation error) in the forms and give appropriate errors for each. Your cloud function should be able to make the skeleton document of the user upon registration.",
        "Try making different permutations of errors possible to test your app’s functionality.",
        "By now, you should be comfortable with handling location services. I'd recommend you to store this location data in a widget called ",
        ", which is similar to shared preferences but with subscription to the data. I'd also recommend you to use some provider widgets to make this variable available down the widget tree, this will come in handy while accessing location data in different pages.",
        "Make sure your documents in the shop collection have a field for storing the location data of the shop. The data structure that we'll be using here is a map, with two keys:",
        "Fully explore the GeoFlutterFire package and experiment with different radius for queries.",
        "Implement small features like locking the place order button if some of the products in the cart are not available nearby.",
        "We're just using the current user location for querying, see if you can change the centre of the query by passing a different geo data.",
        "Display the address from the geo data collected.",
        "Now the application will only show nearby stores or products offered by nearby stores. This includes search results, filters, sorts etc.\n",
        "By now you should have a basic application ready without the payment system. Although you can still have an option to complete the order with cash on delivery, it's always better to have an online payment system. Here, we're going to use Paytm APIs because it covers all the major online payment methods like cards, netbanking, UPIs etc.",
        "Since Paytm provides its own web based UI for the payment portal, we don't have to focus much on the UI part. Instead we'll just use a web view to simply aid the payment portal.",
        "We'll be implementing firebase cloud functions and then integrating the payment web API into those firebase functions. Further we'll be using those functions in our flutter application using web view.",
        "You should now have a working online payment system. The complete UI should look something like this:",
        "Payment web view:",
        "Transaction status page:",
        "This part is completely optional, but push notifications does give that fancy touch to the application.",
        "We'll be using Firebase cloud messaging to implement easy push notifications. Find documentation on Firebase cloud messaging ",
        ".",
        "Your application should now be equipped with a strong push-notification system. Users will now receive customized notifications at various different events.",
        "Till now, you have set up your app’s basic form. Now it’s time to amp up the app by adding some interesting features.",
        " This is an optional milestone for those who want to go that extra mile.",
        "Here are some recommendations you can adopt to make your app even better:",
        "A profile page. Here, the user can edit all the personal information like phone number, address.",
        "Automated email and texts. Use of automated emails and texts for verifications and sending useful information.",
        "Products recommendations.",
        "Use of google analytics, for better understanding the user behaviour towards the application. Check this ",
        " for more details.",
        "A proper functioning search bar.",
        "Users should have the option of sharing the product details to other users.",
        "Using advanced flutter animations to further improve the appearance of the application.",
        "Add a feature for collecting user feedbacks.",
        "Every products and shops can be rated by the users.",
        "Customised search results based on user's activity.",
        "Finally when you're all done, publish your app to the google playstore.",
        "Make necessary changes for the iOS devices and then move forward to publish it in the app store as well.",

        "The main objective of this milestone is to make sure that you understand the basic overflow of the project. Also, you should have a code editor and apache distribution in place. With this you should be able to access the MySQL, phpmyadmin home page and your project files.",
        "Let's start ourselves from the result section!!",
        "What exactly we want from our system? Yes, you are thinking it right. We want from our system that it should take student details as input such as ",
        ", ",
        ", ",
        " (for hiding it from other students, if required) and produce his/her result as output. Make a ",
        " file with some convenient name and make a form which takes ",
        " and ",
        " as input. On submit, it should perform required SQL query(s) to obtain the result as output.\n",
        "\n",
        "But wait! From which table are we going to fetch the required data? Did we create any table in the ",
        " database? Yes, you are right, we don't have any table yet. Go ahead and create a table called ",
        ". But what should be the attributes in the table? The simplest table should have at least these following attributes -",
        "Apart from that you can add attributes if you want such as gender, mail, contact number, etc. But this should be there for proper data storing and fetching. Shouldn't it?",
        "You should be able to make a database, table and attributes with some data into it. You should also be able to get student data as input, parse it, perform search queries and output it to the user.",
        "Let's analyze our previous database from various DBMS perspectives.\n",
        "The answer to all the questions is ",
        ", why? Think about it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's suppose if some student data is changed like address, contact number, etc. Then, we have to reflect that change at all the entries in the database because there are many entries for a single unique student depends on number of subjects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, it is not looking great if we have to scale it for various classes, schools, etc. Because at the end data will become more and more redundant. Also, we can't perform other high level operations on this current database due to its not so good looking structure.",
        "You should be able to justify why this database will not be a good fit in terms of various purposes that are mentioned above. You should be able to understand what normalization is and why there is need to normalize.",
        "Let's split our original table ",
        " into various usable and manageable tables. The tables are split in a manner such that data will remain consistent.",
        "You should be able to make various tables for this database and its corresponding attributes.",
        "Now, as we have our new database structure, we definitely have to rewrite the SQL queries for student result fetching.\n",
        "\n",
        "Start from what your user will type at the front-end. We can safely assume that your user will know at least his/her Roll Id, Class Name and Section. But our user doesn't know that how the class name and section is stored in the database. Also, we as developers don't know that how users will type his/her class name and section because there are many possibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, to make it clear for both the user and you, we should give them a drop-down menu of all the classes in our database. From which table of our database we will do it? Yes, you are right from ",
        " table. User will see his/her class name along with section and in return we will store the class id.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the code for your reference.",
        "Store the roll id and class id in some variables on the redirected page after user click submit.",
        "Now, coming to the query part where we bind our above parameters and fetch student result. Result should at least contains his/her subject name (not subject id because user don't know about subject id at all), corresponding marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the query for the same.",
        "You should be able to fetch and output student result accurately by taking input as per your willingness.",
        "As said earlier this project is divided into 3 parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "We settled up things for the front-end and database, it's time to move towards the back-end part.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Till now we have been doing our back-end part with the database. But this is not looking convenient for adding, deleting and modifying data. That's why there is a need to make a separate back-end portal where we can add/update student details like class, subject, subject combination, result and other details through a proper UI.",
        "The main motive of this milestone is to understand the concept behind making an admin portal. You should be able to design basic outline of the admin portal.",
        "Let's try to build each module (renamed option to module).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, I will explain 2 functionalities - add and update classes. Rest all are similar in nature just the SQL query changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make a form which takes all the input corresponding to each attribute in ",
        " table.",
        "On submitting the form it should perform a MySQL insert query into the ",
        " of same database.",
        "Your back-end code should resemble below code -",
        "Make a table which shows all the classes details such as serial number, class name, class section, etc. depending on your table structure.",
        "Make an extra column for each row for editing that entry in the database, attach the class id with that value.",
        "Print the existing details in form format for that class id to user using MySQL select command which user can change.",
        "After submitting form, the back-end of that page should perform MySQL update query as follows -",
        "You should able to design, code and test each module using your admin portal and ",
        " database server.",
        "Now, the need arises to secure this admin section. Why? Because otherwise students will change theirs and others results and details which in turn becomes a very serious issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two ways to secure this admin section - first is to separate this portal completely with new location and project while the second is to make it password protected. First is not actually a full proof solution. Why? Because if anyone gets to know about this portal and its location then eventually the same problem still persists. So, we will go with the second approach.",
        "Make a new table into database with attributes - ",
        " and ",
        ".",
        "Fill these values depending on the administrative team.",

        "If the entries filled are correct then store these values in the session for future reference and land him to the actual admin section.",
        "The main motive of this milestone is to make admin section secure. You should be able to authenticate the person before sending him to the admin section.",
        "Now, we are at the end stage of this project. We will try to put all things together and test it. Additionally you will learn how to generate PDF with required content so that one can download and share it wherever he/she wants.",

It is the most important step in any application as it keeps the app secure by ensuring the users are verified.\nIn this project, we will first implement the most basic form of authentication i.e. user-id and password based authentication.

Here what happens is that a request is sent to the server and since the request contains the credentials (in some form), the server can verify the authenticity of our request, and give us access to our Gmail accounts. But let's suppose we again type 'gmail.com' in the browser after sometime i.e. we are again sending a request to the server for our account access, and as before the server doesn't know anything about us. So, logically the server will ask you again for your credentials (i.e. email-id & password) but do we need to re-enter our credentials again? We don't. Server will give us the required access again this time too without us re-entering our credentials.",

In this task you will learn about web app servers, connecting your app to a target server and run the app on localhost to test out the app. Also the concept of API will be briefed here.",
        "You might have noticed, as and when we are adding more and more APIs, managing everything using the 'HTTP' module alone will become complicated. Even adding a single API will require us to look at the entire code and then add the new API at appropriate parts of the code. We will try to simplify that in this module.",
        "We will be building a small part of ",

        "After you have implemented the project till here, your app should function like this -",
        "Now that we know a way legitimate users can update their profile i.e. we have implemented one private API. But, one issue here is that every time a user wants to update his profile, he needs to enter their credentials again and again. This is not at all a good user experience (think how will you feel when every time you type ",
        " we have to re-enter your credentials every time). In this module we will try to fix this behaviour.",
        "The idea is that instead of sending ",
        " and ",
        " with each request, we will send ",
        " and ",
        " in the first request. The server then sends us a token which is valid for a particular duration. Now, every time we need to send a request to a private API, we will send the token instead and if the token is valid, the server will know that the user requesting the info is legitimate.",
        "It is a good idea to always send ",
        " in headers. It will help in separating the logical request with the authentication part.",
        "To test whether the ",
        " really expires or not, you can set the expiry to 1 minutes and test the same instead of waiting for it to expire after 1 hr.",
        "Remember, the information encoded with ",
        " is publicly accessible. So, never include sensitive information in your token.",
        "It is recommended to use the 3rd optional argument in ",
        " library instead of manually setting the expiry in the payload.",
        "Though at the end it will add a few arguments in the payload only. It has a few advantages -",
        "After you have successfully implemented the APIs, the app behaviour will look something like below -",
        "We have almost finished our backend APIs. A few things to solve for -",
        "In this module we will primarily fix these 2 issues.",
        "The app should behave like before after you have successfully implemented the APIs -",
        "You might have seen several services which send you an email whenever you login or perform some actions on the application.\nSuppose you want to build similar functionality for your application. As you might have noticed, we might need to send email in a lot of use cases. So, let's build a separate API which just sends an email. Everyone should not be able to access this internal API. That API should be accessed only by us and by our other APIs. How do you prevent other users accessing this API?",
        "In this module you will learn the basic idea of building an API which can only be accessed internally or by us.",
        "Everytime you call ",

        "Here, we will see how to create database models, migration scripts which will help communicate with the database and als get introduced to the lucid model. Adonis has a very easy way to create new models, migrations. By default,the boilerplate has two models and database script for your reference.",
        "Below is an example to refer to creating the project migration script.",
        "Below is the example you can refer to:",
        "By default, the id is incremental which means it will start from 1 and will keep incrementing. You can also go for a randomly generated id. Research a bit to know how you can generate random user ids.",
        "If your migration runs are successful, you will see the tables created in the MySQL workbench.\n",
        "Here, we will learn what is the role of a controller in a MVC design pattern & how we handle incoming HTTP requests or send responses back via a controller. Here you will handle the routing also.",
        "So the project controller should have functions to handle all these requests and should be routed through created endpoints.",
        "So write functions to register a user and implement login facilities. Use auth functions like below:",
        "Once your controllers are ready, run the server (in development mode) by",
        "Test with Postman whether routing is happening or not by printing debug messages onto the console. You will have a detailed testing module in the tasks ahead to check whether the backend is working or not.\n",
        "In this module, we will see some detailing about authentication and how we can do authentication by using the ",
        " middleware.",
        "Middlewares are something that hooks into the request lifecycle. There are a set of functions to be executed in sequence to transform the request/response. A middleware can be named, global or server. Check out the references to know more about middlewares.",
        "Here we will use ",
        " as middleware which will serve the authentication purpose. 'auth' uses different authentication schemes such as basic, jwt, session etc. You can use 'jwt' as the authenticator scheme.",
        "Add the middleware in your routing file so that request goes through ",
        " first.",
        "Whenever there is a request at the user registration endpoint, it should send back a jwt token in the response which will be used for further authentication purposes. This token should be used in sending further requests for that user. You can include the jwt token in the request header.",
        "Add support in controllers so that a controller keeps check of authentication. For instance, a user should not be able to fetch other users' projects. As a practice you can first fetch the user of the requested project and check whether the corresponding jwt token matches with the header jwt token or not. This is a standard practice of doing authentications.",
        "Add logic to your controller for 403 forbidden access and 404 resource not found responses. Handling these types of exceptions would make the simple ToDo backend a robust one. Also, think of other possible exceptions and add support for that. You can create exception handler separately by,",
        "Once auth is added after requesting at 'auth/register' endpoint the response data should include jwt token. Head on to ",
        " to decode the jwt token and you should find the user id in the decoded message.\n",
        "As we discussed, an important feature of our backend is whenever we delete a project all the related tasks should also be deleted. That's why we need transactions.",
        "Once the transactions are written, you shouldn't find the tasks associated with a deleted project in the database.\n",
        "Now we shall start the intensive testing of the API you have built using Postman. API testing involves testing the application programming interfaces (APIs) directly and as part of integration testing to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security. In API Testing, instead of using standard user inputs (i.e. using some kind of GUI) and outputs, you use software to send calls to the API, get output, and note down the system's response.",
        "In this module you will test all the APIs you have developed so far. This is a mandatory step before proceeding towards the front end part. Make sure all your endpoints are working as per expectation. Check out the responses you are receiving are correct or not.",
        "First create a user by sending a request to the endpoint",
        "where {{url}} is an environment variable you should save in postman. Check out the environment tab on your upper left side. {{url}} is the base url by default ",
        ". It should be the same as what is in your .env file.",
        "As a response, you should get back the jwt token and then onwards use this ",
        " token in the header (Authentication) to send a request to other endpoints. For instance, log in with the registered user by using the jwt token you got. say, you want to send a project PUT request for this user then, add this jwt token in the header (Authentication) to pass the auth middleware.",
        "Try accessing other users projects. For example, the project with id 5 belongs to user-2. While sending GET to request to {{url}}/projects/5 send the jwt token of user-1 in the header. Check what you are getting as a response. You should get 403 forbidden access (obvious but you need to implement this logic from the preceding task)",
        "Due to the backend being so extensive, the frontend has been left to your own vivid implementations. So do not stop here and try to build a simple frontend for this app to complete your ToDo app.",
        "Below are few of the Postman testing outcomes which are expected.",
        "Here is the demo on how the backend (of a ToDo app) is working. This is tested again with the help of Postman."

        "This Product Architecture consists of 5 stages as follows:",
        "The final automated process will be like this -",
        "First we set up the environment and ",
        " and do a low level implementation (Proof of Concept) of the components involved in the project. For this we are going to automate the login process to get started.",
        "You may go through ",
        " as well for dependency installation.\nIn this example Firefox has been used as the browser but you are free to use any browser of choice; the only aspect that varies is the change in web driver packages for each browser.",
        "There are some nice to have settings like profiles and options you can go through in ",
        "Example:",
        "Install ",
        " and all other necessary packages",
        "Explore how ",
        " and ",
        " works.",
        "Import all necessary libraries in the script.",
        "Open Instagram login page using driver. Use driver.get(url) to open instagram login page.",
        "Checkout unique identifiers for the input fields login and passwords.",
        "Explore how ",
        " help locating various elements in a web page.",
        "Examples:",
        "Discover login, password and submit elements and interact with them to achieve sign in. Use driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath) to find the elements and use input_element.send_keys(“text”) to send text in the input boxes. Use submit_element.click() to achieve click action.",
        "The idea of this milestone is that you should explore how a web page is structured and how to inspect various components of a webpage like input fields, text, buttons etc. before interacting with them.\nThen to achieve automated login activity with just a few lines of code.\n",
        "When we open the explore page we need to click on the first post to get started with the crawling. After that we need to click on the like button to like the post and click on the next icon to advance to further posts. At this stage we need to store the URL of the images/videos in a metadata csv along with other attributes like profile name, number of likes, and comments etc, to be able to process it later. Further if we need to comment as well, we can use send_keys function in selenium to simulate typing by a user. Here we can store some hard coded messages in an array in a json file to be loaded at time of running and randomly publishing comments from this array.",
        "Alternatively, we can also use ML to detect sentiment of the post using the post description text/other comments to further improve it. But for basic proof of concept we will stick to either hard coded responses or duplicate other comments. Further we can follow a profile using the following button. After following a page we can also redirect to that page and like other sets of posts on that page as well.",
        "Now, to prevent thrashing and throttling at instagrams servers, we need to limit our requests for that we need to put sleep of random time at various stages of our script. Also, instead of crawling just the explore page generically, we can also crawl particular tags as well.",
        "Open various starter links for explore page/ tags page/ profile page using driver.get, note here while using driver.get function our page might reload and we can lose reference to previously stored elements in variables.",
        "Explore element ",
        " and ",
        " functionality to interact with buttons. This might be needed for two reasons, one selenium can't interact with an element if it's not in the view, and secondly, in modern web pages content loads dynamically, so scrolling down may trigger loading of additional content. We can also achieve scrolling by running javascript functions using python as shown below.",
        "The idea of this milestone is that you should explore how to interact with the webpage and automate various interactions like clicking and typing which can be done using selenium. Also, it will also help to grasp the concept of rate limiting and throttling and how to prevent it.",
        "The automation process should be like this -",
        "In this task we will use ",
        " functionality from ",
        " library to fetch posts from Instagram's server. While the automation is running it can encounter various ",
        " for which we need to handle them using pythons; and this is called exception handling. We also need to log these errors to further develop the script.",
        "The metadata (consisting of pictures, videos, comments mainly) are collected so that they can be subjected to some ML /DL models from which you can further advance this project by gaining analysis reports, like sentiment/emotion analysis, auto-reply and much more.",
        ": This is a completely optional task and as it is just an idea for you to work on. If you are in for a challenge then surely you should try this out. Else you can simply skip this milestone.",
        "The idea of this Milestone is that you should explore how to make requests to server to fetch the data and how to handle and log exceptions in python\n",
        "Publish your project by making a new GitHub repository and have some green goodness!\n",
        "You should be able to deploy the application on a cloud platform.\n",

However, last month, the QMoney research team came up with another product that did the technical analysis on the portfolio, stocks and their historical performance, to suggest the new stocks to buy. This library was running on bleeding edge versions of Tensorflow, and required minimum versions were Ubuntu 20+ and python 3.8+",

        "This problem becomes even challenging when you have multiple releases that work across different stacks. Think about different combinations of different versions of Java and python which you want to run on the same machine. That makes it extremely difficult to manage the ecosystems.",
        "In older days, we used to set up separate machines in the development environment in order to replicate multiple versions of a product. Very soon it became so difficult to manage, but then we came up with Virtual machines.",

        "Setup default configurations",
        "Create user groups that have specialized access",
        "Setup startup/ shutdown scripts",
        "Configure system services.",

        "Which means, every software installed on your system pollutes your system in a way!",
        "Containers solve this problem. Assume you want to run the rabbit mq on your system, it can be done in single command",
        "Try running this command in your terminal. It will download and run a rabbitmq server in no time. While you still have to make database and other configurations, the most challenging part of prerequisites and everything else is solved.",

        "This time, the command finished in milliseconds, which obviously happened because of some sort of cache. What kind of cache iis it?",
        "It's usually called layers in docker world.",
        "Introduction video to docker layers",
        "Now, let’s try to go with a little complex example. Lets say, we want to build a container from a spring boot application",
        "Here is the docker file, We will first try to understand the docker file, and then look at what happens when we run it.",
        "This spring starter has a file named ",

        "Let's take a look at the steps involved in building this image.",
        "Baseline for this image is gradle:jdk11 image available on docker hub. The details are available ",
        "Next is ARG command, that sets up a temporary environment variable which enabled non-interactive install",
        "From step 3-9 are few commands that install required softwares on the machine.",
        "Step 10 is changing the underlying user to ROOT",
        "Step 11 is a COPY command that can copy files from Host filesystem to guest filesystem",
        "Step 12 and 13 are about making another directory ",
        " and copying the contents of current directory on host os to ",
        " on the guest os.",
        "Step 14 is again another command that actually builds the copied spring application and generates a bootable jar that can be used as a server.",
        "The last line is about defining entrypoint. While you can say that everything from Step 1-14 attributes to the container image, Step 15 is executed when you start the container for the first time. When you start the container, the command mentioned as ",
        " will be executed.",
        "Let's try to create the image now.",
        "Now go to hub.docker.com,  We have the same image pushed over there. ",
        "Click on tags.",
        "Click on ",

        "Click on the commands shown there to see the details of each command",
        "Layers is nothing but something similar to ",
        ". When you execute any command during docker image creation, the changes are recorded as a layer, and not persisted on the image.",
        "When a container starts, these changes are \"Computed\" based on layer information, and the filesystem is derived.",
        "By now, you know that containers share the file resources with host operating system, including kernel and process space.",
        "Can you push your own images to docker repository?",
        "Now, create an account on https://hub.docker.com",

        "Understand how to make REST API calls",
        "REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Don’t worry - no one’s gonna ask you the meaning of each word :)",
        "API stands for Application Programming Interface, and unfortunately, people will ask you the meaning of each word here. An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. You don’t go into a cafe and walk straight into the kitchen to tell the chef what you wanna eat. The waiter does that for you, and that’s exactly what an API is - with the client being you, the customer and any resource that can send data, being the chef.",
        "Now, these APIs have different styles, or in more formal terms - conventions and architectures about how they are used.",
        "REST APIs are those APIs which follow the guidelines set by the REST architecture. They follow a client-server model where one software program sends a request and the other responds with some data. REST APIs commonly use the HTTP protocol to send requests & receive responses.",
        "How an API request differs from a usual HTTP request for a webpage, is in terms of the data returned. HTTP requests for webpages return HTML, CSS & JavaScript files which are rendered by the browser and displayed to the user. But, in the case of APIs, the request can be for any data (not just webpage) and the response is read by the requesting program which interprets the data.",
        "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation - how cryptic :| ) is a standard format that is easily \"understandable\" by applications and can be handled well in most languages. So the data format in REST is usually JSON. For example, an Android app can effortlessly utilize data sent by a Node.js server. XML is another popular format for data transfer between applications.",
        "The following video will give you a quick overview of REST API.",
        "The APIs shown in the video might require authentication when you try it out (Authentication is done so that a spammy bot(aka, hacker) doesn’t send ten quadrillion requests to a resource and blast its servers out. It can be caught and stopped)",

        "Which ones did you try out? (You can try out a Chrome extension like ",
        " to format the JSON response in your browser window)",
        "As we discussed earlier, REST API calls are made on top of the HTTP protocol. We can analyse the network packets during the API calls to confirm this using Wireshark.\n",
        "\n",
        " is a popular network analysis tool to capture network packets and display them at a granular level. Once these packets are broken down, you can ",

        " status code and JSON data on line 10. (API request was made to ",
        ", see ",
        ")",
        "Do note, REST is one architectural pattern used, NOT the only one. There are some has beens, like SOAP and some new kids on the block, like GraphQL. These patterns differ in the ways in which they ask for data, send data, and how they enforce these practices. You’ll find links to them in the Takeaways section - so do reach there ASAP.",

        "With plans to regain lost ground, the company wants to revamp its code and start adding support for other kinds of media.",
        "Let’s look at the current code base. Look at the files in the outermost directory of the ",
        " you have cloned. The focus is on the ",
        " class object, which is passed between multiple methods to make the messaging happen. The class contains all data fields that are relevant to the text message.",
        "The ",
        " class is defined in ",
        ".",
        "It has fields like ",
        ", ",

        "It has methods to access these data fields from outside the class. There are getters (methods to read value of fields) & setters (methods to write values of fields) for the above fields. This shows it has been designed with Encapsulation in mind.",
        "Note: The field names with leading double underscores is how we say it’s restricted for direct access from outside the class. This is because Python doesn’t support \"private\" fields/methods by default.",
        "We have methods inside ",
        " that implement the functionality to send messages making use of the ",
        " class.",
        " - method that wraps the other methods below to process & send the message. This will be invoked by the android client (simulated by main.py here).",
        " - method to check the message to be sent for offensive content and takes in as argument a string (",
        ")",
        " - method that stores the message info for later use and requires a ",
        " object as argument",
        " - method which handles the actual message sending to the receiver",
        "Let’s do a simple demo of our app now by using the methods available. We have some code in ",
        " that does this",
        "Wanna try running ",
        "? Execute the below command",

        "Voice message",
        "Image message",
        "The fields and methods required for each Message Type is listed in the table below.",
        "Note: This doesn’t show the full list of messages. It shows a subset that is sufficient for the current topic.",
        "The technical architect has now requested the team members to brainstorm and come up with design options and their drawbacks.",
        "One way to go about introducing new types of messages is to add more fields in our original ",
        " class. How would we do that?",
        "This implementation is available inside the ",
        " directory.",
        "The new ",
        " class implementation is provided in ",
        ". We can see that there are new fields added, specific to the text, voice and image message types in the ",
        " class itself. There is a field to differentiate between the types as well.",
        "There are new getter & setter methods for dealing with the new message types as well. So, whenever we create objects of ",
        " class for one type of message, all fields specific to the other message types will simply be untouched.",
        "If we check the ",
        ", there are separate methods for processing & delivering the varied types of messages using methods provided by ",
        ". (\tandroid_client_handler.py has changed from the previous form where only text messages were required. Compare them to see the differences)",
        "For the most part, ",
        " is similar to the earlier ",
        ". The earlier ",
        " methods are now renamed with ",
        " methods and an example of image message has also been added.",
        "Execute this and see the output",
        "The ",
        " class contains elements and methods related to all 3 message types, but only some of them are required by the clients based on the message type. Even if a client (e.g. android_client_handler.py) wants only a text message, they will get all other fields in the Message object which they wouldn’t use.",
        "Extending this code with more message types will add more elements and methods in the ",
        " class, making it difficult to maintain.",
        "Another manner to go about supporting new types of messages will be to create different classes for each. Each one takes care of a single message type. Yeah! Something like carbon-copies of our ",
        " class. Each of these classes will have all the common fields & their methods as well as fields & methods specific to that message type. As the classes will only be having fields & methods they absolutely require, there won’t be any unused functionality.",
        "Note: No code has been provided for this proposal. You should implement this proposal and compare the files to see the differences.",
        "Lot of repeated code across these classes. Change needed in one of the common fields or methods would mean modifying all these classes. Low maintainability and low extensibility.",
        "To add support for a new message type, we would add another new class which is independent, but with repeated fields and methods.",
        "However, the tech lead is not fully satisfied with these proposals. He thinks they are not easily maintainable. Something is missing here and they can do better.",
        "Yes, this situation is just right for Inheritance.",
        "The definition of inheritance is that the parent/base class holds the common fields and methods, while the child classes get to inherit the parent’s fields and methods and add their own on top of it.",
        "That way each child class (representing one message type) remains independent of other child classes.",
        "This implementation is available inside the ",
        " directory.",
        "Inside ",
        ", we use a ",
        " parent class to define fields & their methods which are common to all types of messages. E.g. message id, sender, receiver etc.",
        "For each of the message types, namely, Text, Image & Voice, we create new children classes ",
        ", ",
        " & ",
        ". These children classes inherit the ",
        " class and hence need only add any fields and methods specific to them.",
        "Code reuse for common fields and methods (by inheriting parent class) as opposed to repeated code in the earlier Proposal 2.",
        "Clean class structure for the child classes that are easily maintainable. Each message type can be modified without impacting other classes since it holds fields/methods specific to itself.",
        "The Clients get only the fields and methods for the message type they are interested in by creating an object of the child class. This is in contrast to getting all fields by creating an object of a large single Message class, as was the case with Proposal 1 earlier.",
        "Execute this and see the output",
        "Pay close attention to these lines of code.",
        "Note that with the Inheritance based design, the invocation of the methods need to know which exact message type to use. This is not very good.",
        "Inheritance has helped clean up the structure from the service provider side/implementation side (message.py). We’ll see how this design can be further improved to help the caller/client side (android_client_handler.py) when we visit Polymorphism.",

        "This can lead to inconsistent behavior.",
        "Results in code duplication which makes maintenance difficult. Whenever a new change is to be implemented related to the user preferences, the developer needs to work out the changes for each of the handlers separately.",
        "We saw what encapsulation is in the ",
        " section earlier. Is our current implementation encapsulated?",
        "Nope. The handlers are triggering an update to the country and language fields directly. Each one is implementing its own validation logic.",
        "Repeating code is never good. It is better to have common methods in one place, which can be used by all other methods.",
        "What is the best place to put a method?",
        "A method should be placed closed to its relatives. If you are using classes, all methods that work on the data fields in that class should be within the class itself, making it a cohesive unit. This is precisely what encapsulation offers!",
        "The main advantage is this. The data fields of the class will not be modified from outside methods. This puts the state of the class object in the hands of the methods it exposes. So, the object stays in control. It is its own master.",
        "Note: In Java, the ",
        " access specifier can be used to hide the data fields from outside access.",
        "We have answered the ",
        " about encapsulation, let’s look at the ",
        " in the next section.",
        "Let’s see how to re-design our current implementation to satisfy encapsulation.",
        "We have an Encapsulation based implementation of our country-language validation inside the ",
        " file as the ",
        " class. Class? Yeah, we’ve enclosed everything related to user preferences in a class. Let’s check the methods provided by the class",
        " - empty constructor for the class i.e, we’ll be able to create objects without passing any parameters. But, isn’t ",
        " a parameter? Hmm, not really! ",
        " denotes the object itself.",
        " - constructor that takes in parameters. We can see that ",
        " is a mandatory parameter and the other two defaults to ",
        " if not provided",
        " - wraps our validation logic which the handlers will now be utilizing for updating the user’s language preference",
        " - utility method to update user’s country preferences",
        " - stores the user preferences to the ",
        " file. The leading ",
        " in the method name denotes the method isn’t to be used outside of the class.",
        " - Hidden method to read current user preferences from the ",
        " file.",
        "You might be thinking, \"Why are the variable names starting with ",
        ", don’t you like normal names?\"",
        "This is just a naming convention in python, which signifies that the field is not supposed to be accessed directly from outside the class.",
        "If you check our new handler implementations, you’d see that both of them are using the same method, ",
        " of the ",
        " class to update the user's language preference. The handler doesn't need to worry about how the user language is updated anymore.",
        "Run the ",
        " file & verify the contents of the user_preferences.json file is correct",
        "What are the different places we now need to check when the update language feature doesn’t work as expected? Just one, right?",
        "Not only was code duplication avoided but also the developers working on the handlers can do their job and let the class methods (who know their own class variables better), do their job.",
        "The new feature is clearly becoming a hit. With data available for the user’s country & preferred language, we are able to provide a much more personalized experience to the users. It’s time to open up our application to a much wider audience - add support for 2 more countries and 4 more languages with specific validation.",
        "With the encapsulation based code, isn’t it much easier to implement than before?",
        "Welcome to the encapsulation enlightened world! :)",
        "Practical scenarios",
        "Data gets passed between method/function calls all the time. With increasing complexity, we will end up passing more and more variables between methods which are related to a common cause. It is best to model these variables as a single object and pass the object between the methods. Encapsulation ensures only the necessary sections of the object are modifiable across all the methods.",
        "Simple example: Passing variables to represent a matrix - a 2D array, number of rows, number of columns - can be replaced by a matrix object.",
        "Another example: A product for sale has these fields - price, category, discount percentage, vendor name etc. These can be modeled as an object with methods to change the price, discount etc.",
        "Having encapsulation ensures that situations like renaming of a variable doesn’t impact the external methods that are using the class method to get or set this variable.",
        "Summary of Encapsulation",
        "Encapsulation is achieved by the object making its state (data fields) restricted to private access. External objects cannot access them directly. They can only access the state through the methods exposed by the objects.",
        " is it useful? - Sets the stage to restrict access to data fields and keeps the object in control of what fields can be modified and how. Ensures consistent behavior across users of this object.",
        " to apply? - While designing any class that has data fields and needs methods to be supported for their reading or modification.",
        " to apply? - Provide public methods for reading or updating the data fields in the class only as needed. E.g. get() or set() methods.",
        "What is the drawback if we don’t use encapsulation? - Duplication of code. Low maintainability. Inconsistent behavior. Difficult to test. Possible inappropriate access/modification from external methods.",
        "Language specific notes",
        "In Python, we name our variables starting with dunders(",
        ") to explicitly mark them as hidden variables as Python doesn’t support this behaviour by default.",
        "More OOPS aligned programming languages like C++/Java/Ruby provide access modifiers like public/private that we can utilize effectively to achieve encapsulation. Here, getter/setter methods are portals to the class state.",
        "General encapsulation notes",
        "Restricts direct access to data members of a class.",
        "Fields are set to private if language supports it, else treated as such",
        "Each field has a getter and setter method",
        "Getter methods return the field",
        "Setter methods let us change the value of the field",
        "Does prefixing variables with dunders (",
        ") in Python like we did really make them hidden from outside access? Is there some way to still access & manipulate them?",

        "Yeah, something like",
        "We can see that the criteria set by the TextMessage team is that the message size to be at most 100 for it to be considered a valid message. The ImageMessage team is more moderate about the condition for an image message to be valid & is only checking if the message has any content.",
        "As the methods were implemented independently by different teams, we can see a difference in the method names used.",

        "Every time a new message type is introduced or teams want to have their own implementation, the Clients would need to make code changes.",
        "A more OOPSie way to deal with the new requirement is to add a method with default implementation in the base class.

        " for interacting with the config files. The files will be stored inside the ",
        " directory. Currently, we’re going with the JSON format to store our configurations as it is pretty common & easy to deal with.",
        "We have many product teams that have to deal with multiple types of configuration. All of them have similar implementations that utilize the ",
        " class methods, for reading/storing specific configuration from/to disk as JSON. For example, the Inventory team’s config handler is ",

        "Sample XML file",
        "Not exactly easy for us to read, right? Though XML compromises on human-readability it comes with its advantages as we saw earlier.",
        "One way to implement XML support is to add new methods to read & write XML configuration files inside our ",
        " class. Teams can then utilize these methods.",
        "This version can be found inside the ",
        " directory",
        "If we look inside ",

        "The earlier implementation for dealing with JSON configuration is now renamed to ",
        " from ",
        ". Similarly, for the write method as well.",
        "The Logistics team has shifted to XML based configuration, while the Inventory and Vendor teams stay with JSON.",
        "Let’s also check how the implementation of the Logistics team changed in ",
        ".",
        "Ok, they had to change their original implementation by modifying the method names and parameters at multiple places.",
        "Try running the ",
        " file",
        "Compare the contents of ",
        " file, that was just created with the ",
        " file from our earlier implementation. Same configuration, different format, right?",
        "The above design works but has some disadvantages.",
        "Adding support for another file type will involve creating even more methods in config_manager.py, making it cluttered. For now, we have renamed previous methods and added two new methods.",
        "The Clients using this code need to make corresponding changes to method names and parameter values, which might be getting invoked in multiple places.",
        "With the implementation in the previous milestone, we see that new methods were put into the config_manager class. This keeps the implementation in one place. However, with more and more methods being added, the config_manager is catering to multiple use cases which are better off in their own class. Having their own class will make it easier to maintain and have clear responsibilities.",
        "Also, the users explicitly need to use method names based on the file type and are no longer generic. If they are making this call in multiple places, users would need to replace all occurrences, if they need to change the file type.",
        "Abstraction addresses these shortcomings by clearly defining a common method signature. Separate classes can implement the same method but internally read the file type of choice. From a user perspective, the methods don’t change based on file type and it is easy to change from one type to another with minimal changes.",
        "Let’s go through an Abstraction driven design for this requirement to see how it is better.",
        "We had a couple of shortcomings:",
        " class is catering to multiple use cases",
        "Method names in ",
        " are to be changed in all places they’re used.",
        "This redesigned version can be found inside the ",
        " directory.",
        "To combat the first issue, we go with an abstract class ",
        " inside ",
        ". Abstract class? Yeah, we won’t provide any implementation in this class, just the method names. Other classes will then implement these methods based on the file types they need to support.",
        "Let’s look at what the method definitions are trying to say",
        " - sets an abstract method ",
        " which takes a single parameter, ",
        " denoting the configuration file name. No, ",
        " isn’t another parameter but just denotes object of the ",
        " class itself",
        " - defines the abstract method ",
        " which takes two parameters, configuration file name & the configuration data to be written to the config file.",
        "Now, the fancy annotation ",
        " along with the ",
        " method is required as Python doesn’t support abstract classes by default.",
        "Now we have the method signature required for reading & writing configuration laid out clearly. Each configuration file type can be supported by a subclass of the ",
        " class which will implement the specific read/write functionality of that type.",
        "You can see that we have a class each for dealing with the JSON & XML configurations. Let’s check the  ",
        " file.",
        "Some points we can comprehend from the code",
        "The ",
        " class is a subclass of the ",
        " abstract class",
        "It implements both of the abstract methods defined in ",
        "Similarly, we have the implementation for the XML type configuration in ",
        "All done, right? Hmm, Not really!",
        "Our earlier implementation had one more drawback - we were dealing with the issue of having to change method names and parameter values in all previous implementations, whenever support for a new config file type was added. This made the code harder to maintain.",
        "How did we deal with this in our new implementation based on Abstraction?",
        "Taking a look at the Logistics team’s implementation in ",
        "As the Logistics team moved to using XML, they are creating an object of the ",
        " class and it’s methods for reading & writing configuration as XML type.",
        "What would the Logistics team need to do if they were having second thoughts to go back to JSON itself? They’d need to just change ",
        " to an object of type ",
        " instead of  ",
        ". Done!",
        "You can use the below command for running ",
        "New requirements have come in, to add support for storing configuration in CSV files and also in a Database.",
        "How easy or difficult is it (with the abstraction based design) to add this support?",
        "Practical scenarios",
        "The Java Virtual Machine is an abstraction. Your code can use the exact same java methods irrespective of whether your code will run on Linux or Windows or any other OS. Underneath, a lot of things will change depending on the OS, which the user doesn’t need to know.",
        "You can use a simple API call to fetch weather data or stock prices. These API abstract out the internal complexities of how it is implemented.",
        "Software libraries are good examples of abstraction. They tell you the methods you can use without telling you how they are implemented.",
        "Summary of Abstraction",
        "It separates the method signature from its implementation.",
        "Closely related classes can separate out common fields/methods into a different class and reuse that class.",
        " is it useful? - To the implementers of the class, it is useful since it provides them with the flexibility to change things as long as the method signatures don’t change. For the users, it keeps them from getting exposed to anything other than the method signatures they need to know, reducing complexity.",
        " to apply? - Use a smaller set of public methods",
        "What is the drawback if we don’t use abstraction? - Low maintainability because responsibilities are not clearly differentiated. Higher Complexity with larger code bases because many objects interact with others and it becomes difficult to add functionality without impacting others.",
        "Language specific notes",
        "In Java, ",
        " classes provides total abstraction and ",
        " classes provide partial abstraction",

        "The Clients using this code need to make corresponding changes to method names and parameter values, which might be getting invoked in multiple places.",
        "With the implementation in the previous milestone, we see that new methods were put into the ",
        " class. This keeps the implementation in one place. However, with more and more methods being added, the ConfigManager is catering to multiple use cases which are better off in their own class. Having their own class will make it easier to maintain and have clear responsibilities.",
        "Also, the users explicitly need to use method names based on the file type and are no longer generic. If they are making this call in multiple places, users would need to replace all occurrences, to change the file type.",
        "Abstraction addresses these shortcomings by clearly defining a common method signature. Separate classes can implement the same method but internally read the file type of choice. From a user perspective, the methods don’t change based on file type and it is easy to change from one type to another with minimal changes.",

        "To combat the first issue, we go with an interface",
        " inside ",
        ". Interface? Yeah, we won’t provide any implementation in this class, just the method names. Other classes will then implement these methods based on the file types they need to support.",

        " which takes two parameters, ",

        " class",
        " - defines the abstract method ",
        " which takes two parameters, configuration file name & the configuration data to be written to the config file.",
        "Now we have the method signature required for reading & writing configuration laid out clearly. Each configuration file type can be supported by a class that implements the interface provided by ",
        ". This class will implement the specific read/write functionality for that type.",
        "You can see that we have a class each for dealing with the JSON & XML configurations. Let’s check the  ",
        " file.",
        "Some points we can understand from the code",
        "The ",
        " class is a subclass of the ",
        " interface",
        "It implements both of the abstract methods defined in ",
        "Similarly, we have the implementation for the XML type configuration in ",
        "All done, right? Hmm, Not really!",
        "Our earlier implementation had one more drawback - we were dealing with the issue of having to change method names and parameter values in all previous implementations, whenever support for a new config file type was added. This made the code harder to maintain.",

        " and select ",

        "We mentioned that memory addresses are grouped as pages. Use the ",
        " program to see if consecutive virtual memory addresses belong to the same physical memory page frame",
        "So, all the contents of a page in virtual memory resides wholly in a page in physical memory. Are consecutive pages in virtual memory consecutive in physical memory as well? Is it necessary to be so in all cases?\n(Hint: Page size = 4096 which is 1000 in hex implies if ",

        "How are you able to run video games of sizes larger than your computer’s RAM?",
        "So, virtual addresses of a process have a corresponding physical memory address. Can two different virtual addresses map to the same physical memory address?",
        "Does a particular VM address map to a specific PM address always? What about in case of a specific program?",

        "What is happening is that when we request the /stats url, it is intercepted by the method above and the output is sent to the browser. So the natural question to ask is where are the stats coming from?",
        "The line responsible for that is ",
        ". A quick peek into ",
        " will lead you to ",
        ". This is where you can see the code that talks to the database.",
        "This time, the line of interest is ",
        ".",
        "And once more, you can take a quick peek into the ",
        " file to see the implementation, except for one problem… There’s no implementation!",
        "Unlike the other times where there was an interface and a corresponding implementation, for the repository class, there is only an interface. Where does the implementation come from?",
        ". The interface acts as a marker to help you capture the ",
        " you need to work with. And the ",
        " is parsed by Spring to generate the query internally. If you observe the interface, it extends ",
        ".",
        "The \"types\" here are ",
        " and ",
        ". ",
        " is the entity to manage (The Entity is a presentation of the row or document in the table or collection in your database). ",
        " is the id of the managed entity object, in this case it is an integer. Also note, the entity class ",
        " be marked with ",
        " for MongoDB to signify to Spring that it must manage it.",
        "The other big advantage is that this repository pattern is an abstraction for different databases. This means, you can use a technology specific abstraction for different databases. The one you are using is ",
        ", but you can use ",
        " for relational databases such as MySQL.",
        "The method name you have invoked is the ",
        " method Spring Data knows you have invoked the findAll() method, from the mongo repository class, then it generates the appropriate query automatically and sends it to the database that the server connects to using the details in ",
        " file.",
        "Phew! That’s a lot of things that are happening under the hood.",
        "That is precisely the advantage of using this pattern. Spring manages the hard work of query generation, connecting and disconnecting to databases and so on so that you can simply invoke one method and continue to focus on the business logic.",
        "So much for the introduction. Next, you will see how to handle querying using this powerful abstraction.",
        "Spring Data offers multiple projects under the same umbrella to connect to various data sources. You can find the entire list here: ",
        "Spring Data Mongo Repository reference: ",
        "Is the method name ",
        " fixed? What if you use ",
        ", can you try it out and see if it works? Why or why not? Can you search the documentation for ",
        " and see how it relates to ",
        "?",
        "Entities managed for Mongo DB must use ",
        ". A \"document\" is a term specific for MongoDB, so does this mean a data source backed by a different technology uses a different annotation? Can you try to figure out what this would be for MySQL?",
        "Previously, you looked at getting all users in the forum and got the count. What if you wanted to select only some users?",
        "Since it has been established that the querying occurs by observing the method name and parameters, it stands to reason that if we tweak these two things, Spring will be able to generate different queries.",
        "Let’s look at the code in the ",
        " once again.",
        "Look at the method this time. From the ",
        " interface, the signature is:",
        "Let’s break this down:",
        "The return type is a List",
        "The method name is different. The query parsing mechanism strips the prefix ",
        " and parses the rest of the method name. The ",
        " is a delimiter by which the rest of the criteria for the underlying query is determined. Generally, this criteria will be the ",
        ". In this case, this is \"username\".",
        "To use multiple properties, operators to concatenate the properties are used, such as ",
        " as well as ",
        ".",
        "So far, it has been established that username is the criteria, but you need a value for this username upon which the User collection can be scanned. This value is provided in the method parameter.",
        "With that, Spring has enough information to generate the query and send it to MongoDB.",
        "Once the user document is retrieved, posts are extracted out of it and returned to the service layer.",
        "If you want to observe the output, you can request the url from the browser preview feature as you did to get the forum stats in module 1. What is the request url? ",
        ": Look at the controller methods and try to figure it out from there.",
        "What if the entity property is longer in words? For example, let’s assume there the entity has properties: ",
        " which signifies city of birth, ",
        " which is for date of birth and ",
        " which is for current city of residence. How will you put this in a method that uses all three as criteria? Is the method name ",
        " correct?",
        ": All the method parsing algorithm needs is a way to differentiate between the criteria. The default is to use camel case as a delimiter, which means you have to use a different delimiter in the above method name. How to do this?",
        "The repository method returns ",
        ", but the username is generally unique in a forum. How would you change the method to return a single user document? Can you try it out?",
        "In this form, the method name is not parsed. Instead, you add a ",
        " annotation to the method and specify a MongoDB json query string.",
        "For example, in the previous task, you used",
        "as the method name which needed to be parsed. Using the query annotation route, its form can be changed to something that looks like this:",
        "Let’s break this down:",
        "The first thing to be observed is that the method name does not play a part here in generating the query here.",
        "The ",
        " in the json query string is the entity property, and the ",
        " is the value you want to give to the criteria. This value is taken from the method parameter. The \"0\" here indicates that it is the first parameter in the query method that should be used as the value. Similarly, you would expect to write ",
        ", ",
        " and so on should more method parameters by used.",
        "With the ",
        " annotation, you gain more power as it is more expressive but the tradeoff for this is that you lose the ease and convenience of the query methods from before. The other tradeoff is that there is a tighter coupling between the query and the underlying technology of the data store as we must know the query semantics of the store.",
        "Let’s take a look at the implementation of the use case where this is utilized.",
        "The objective is to get users whose posts contain the string \"cricket\" in their post content. To do this, you need to search for the string inside an array of posts for every user document. This is not straightforward to do using a query method. But we can turn to the expressive power of ",
        " annotation to solve this problem.",
        "The code in the repository service is as follows:",
        "And the repository method with the annotation is:",
        "Of course, you are not limited to regex operators. You are only limited by the query capabilities offered by mongo. Thus the method annotation form offers pretty much the full expressive power of querying directly on MongoDB.",
        "How many posts contain the word \"ipl\"?",
        "Can you try searching for posts that have a substring ",
        " order it by the time of post creation?",
        "The third form of querying the database that Spring Data offers is MongoTemplate. With each increasing step you have taken, you have traded convenience for expressiveness and flexibility. MongoTemplate is the most powerful form, allowing you to construct dynamic, ad-hoc queries which offer granular control over the other forms.",
        "Let’s go through a previous use case - get users by username.",
        "Let’s break down this usage:",
        "There are three objects here: ",
        " object, ",
        " object, ",
        " object. The ",
        " and ",
        " objects have a fluent style API which makes it easy to chain together criteria and queries programmatically. This offers one big advantage over the other forms: You can construct queries ",
        " Previously, you were effectively limited to \"hard-coded\" queries which means if you query had to be changed based on some system condition, it was not possible unless there was already another query method that could be selected. With this chainable API, you can construct queries in an ad-hoc fashion.",
        "Once the query is created, mongoTemplate can be used to execute the query. Notice the ",
        " method. If you remember your mongo queries, it should be familiar. There are a whole host of methods ",
        " has to help you beside this one.",
        "The answer as always is: It depends. If your queries do not change much, or are relatively straightforward you may prefer query methods. If you want full flexibility to write your own ad-hoc queries, ",
        " may be more preferable. You could also go for a mixed approach through proper layering and decoupling, where you could start off with the relatively simple repository query methods and then start adopting MongoTemplate as and when more expressive queries are required."

This is also the case when you are working as a team and different components of the project will be written by multiple developers, who can all make changes independently.",
        "Let’s look at an example to see the value of this.",
        "What would you feel if you saw this screen when you eagerly typed in some query on Quora?",
        "For someone who has seen a lot of error traces and loves this, the next step would be to go through the adventure of figuring out what the error is saying. But, for a layman user, this won’t make any sense and the user will leave the page. Not only did the user not get what they wanted, but was also not given any information to figure out what went wrong.",
        "How would the user emotion be if the screen was like this?",
        "Here, the user is shown a much more \"usable\" message that communicates what happened. Users would appreciate this and try out the suggestions mentioned here.",
        "Exception Handling allows developers to recover from such errors and handle it gracefully with a clear message to users.",
        "The images are only representative and not real website images from Quora",
        "Though digging into stack traces and finding the root cause of an error will be exciting sometimes, you wouldn’t want to deal with it on a frequent basis. Debugging code takes time and effort.",
        "With any codebase that you work on, it is difficult to debug an error by remembering all the functionality of different classes or how they interacted with each other. Proper utilisation of exception handling procedures can save you a lot of debugging time by including more information when an error is seen.",
        "The above error trace tells you a ",
        " occurred due to so and so reason, as well as the exact location of code where it happened. You cannot be sure, without taking a look at the code, as to what the methods were doing. Then, you need to come up with a hypothesis, do some checks and figure out the exact reason.",
        "What if the error screen was something like this?",
        "The exact context in which the error occurred (when reading a file), cause of the error (cannot deserialize a String) and possible solution (validating the file format) is already there for you. Though, a level of detail like this may not be possible for all scenarios, logging the parameter values and other additional information will help developers debug your application much faster and with less effort.",
        "By going the extra mile of adding some additional information when developing the project you are doing a favor to yourself and to anyone else maintaining the project.",
        "Let’s get to know the files we have in the project that we fetched during the Setup task. The logic is implemented to authenticate users. This is done by checking the username and password they entered against a data source. Application has functionality to perform authentication both when the user is offline (using ",

        " file. The error is due to using the ",
        " method of the ",
        " class which we declared to throw exceptions in the previous section. With what we have learnt till now, regarding exception handling, we can use the ",
        " to handle exceptions. Ensure ",
        " compiles by throwing the exception like we did for the other two methods before. Run it.",
        "The ",
        " method is user-facing (which we’re simulating using the ",

        "What would the user see if ",
        " causes an exception? (Remember we declared it to throw exceptions).",
        "This is exactly what we had discussed in Milestone 1. It is not helpful for the users to see this.",
        "If you recall, the compiler had given you two options to deal with the exceptions earlier. We’ve seen the \"throws\" option. Now, let's explore the second option which is \"catch\". Catching an exception is where we define beforehand how we want to recover when an exception occurs. Java provides the ",
        " statement for that. The part of the code that can cause an exception is wrapped within the ",
        " clause and how we want to recover from an exception is wrapped within the ",
        " clause.",

        ")",
        "What does the user see when there’s an error now? Compile and execute to find out. Isn’t it a much better message for the user?",
        "For the developers to have debugging information whenever the exception occurs, we can use the ",
        " method of the exception object and configure it to be logged to a log file. This will provide information about where exactly the exception occurred.",
        " Use the debugger to check the flow of the program",

However, the reduction in storage costs and massive amounts of unstructured data have paved the way for NoSQL based databases. In a lot of cases where it is not required to deal with complex relational data models that occur due to the large number of tables and the relationships between them, NoSQL comes into play.

        "MongoDB is one of the more popular NoSQL databases in use today.",
        "Understand the need for MongoDB",
        "Learn Mongo shell commands",
        "To start the ",
        ", execute ",
        " in the terminal. You’ll see an output similar to the below snapshot.",
        "Note: All Mongo commands covered in this Byte are to be executed while inside the Mongo shell (unless specified otherwise).",
        "It is schema-free and does away with the need to define a fixed structure. You can just start adding data and it isn’t necessary to have any relation between those. The only restriction with this is the supported data structures.",
        "The document format used in place of rows and columns can be easily mapped by programming languages",
        "Horizontally scalable i.e, data can be distributed across multiple servers to improve performance whereas for relational databases, performance can only be improved by increasing the performance of the server it’s run on.",
        "Provides good support for Hierarchical data like JSON or XML. For large amounts of unstructured data, SQL based DB would be significantly slower.",
        "Offers higher efficiency and reliability which in turn helps with better storage capacity and speed requirements.",
        "Let’s look at some of these in more detail",
        "Let’s take an example of some data to be stored in a database. See the data below, for the weather forecast for London city on January 30, 2017 (given by the \"dt\" ",
        ").",
        "Come up with the different tables that would be required to store this data in a relational (SQL) database.",
        "These tables will be required - Coordinates, Weather, Main, Wind, Clouds, Sys and one parent table which has foreign key relationship to all these other tables.",
        "So, we need to come up with the tables to be used, set data types for all the attributes, define the relationships, and create all these tables before going ahead and adding data to these tables. This is termed as having a \"fixed schema\" as the structure is defined before adding data.",
        "MongoDB uses dynamic schema and inherently supports hierarchical data (nested data) as it’s a NoSQL database. This means that the schema (structure) is dynamically created from the data and individual data entries don't have to be in the same format. Hence, there’s no overhead to adding complex data like we saw above, making it a preferred choice to store this kind of data.",
        "As MongoDB can be scaled horizontally, MongoDB clusters can be geographically distributed on servers to improve query performance.",
        "MongoDB is a persistent (or disk-based) database unlike Redis, which is a NoSQL based in-memory database. Though Redis can be significantly faster than MongoDB when the stored data is smaller in size, MongoDB can operate much faster as the database gets larger.",
        "Sharding is the concept of storing partitions of data (shard) in different database servers.",
        "For sharding in relational databases like MySQL, application level changes are required as well as needing to suffer downtime due to interlinking of the tables. These also require servers with high specifications which are costly.",
        "Due to the horizontal scalability, sharding in MongoDB is cost-effective as buying several low-cost machines is often cheaper than buying a smaller number of machines with significantly higher specifications.",
        "Additionally, MongoDB stores data in the BSON (Binary JSON) format.",
        "BSON basically is an improvised version of the popular JSON format used",
        "BSON supports additional data types like Date out of the box in addition to the data types like String, Boolean, Number, Array supported by JSON.",
        "Parsing data is much quicker with BSON as data isn’t saved in text form (human-readable) as in JSON. BSON adds metadata to like lengths of string used to make queries faster",
        "As popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python has data types (",
        ", ",
        ") to which JSON can be directly mapped, it removes any transformation required to process the data.",
        "However, in the below cases, Relational databases are a better bet than NoSQL databases",
        "If large amount of structured data is to be written and it’s critical to avoid loss of data",
        "If the structure of data may not change, \"fixed schema\" of relational databases can be better even with the overhead of designing the schema as it becomes possible to perform complex queries using SQL",
        "If storage is an issue and need to avoid data redundancy",
        "We’ll be using a practical scenario of storing and processing data for QTravels, which is a Hotel Booking portal. As you can imagine, for a large travel website, there will be innumerable subsystems that work in unison to give the end user a great experience.

        "(Quick note if you are highly adventurous: don’t get started with adding those methods. Save it for the next milestone!)",

        "Ok, where’s the rest of the code? Feel free to put extra spaces but this is all we need to read contents of the JSON file, store them as ",

        " class to map a particular key’s value to? Does something stand out on comparing the ",
        " class & the JSON data?",
        "Hmm, looks like the variable names are the same as the key names. Not convinced? Change the variable names & see what Jackson tells you then (via the stack trace in error)",
        "Isn’t the empty constructor in ",
        " class simply taking up space, do we need that? Or is it the other way around :) (Hint: Put a breakpoint on one of the statements in the constructor with arguments. For empty constructor, add breakpoint on a dummy statement like ",
        ")",
        "What will Jackson do if there are duplicate keys? When would you not want the default behaviour to happen? How would you go on to override the behaviour? Technically speaking, are duplicate keys in JSON to be dealt by the JSON creator or the user? (Hint: RFC)",

        " class if the JSON was like this?",
        "Oh, oh! How would you name a variable ",
        "? Or will we get lucky with Jackson doing some fancy stuff to understand our requirement? Run the ",
        " method with the ",
        " file as parameter.",
        "You’ll get an error, try to understand what it’s trying to let us know. This is where Jackson annotations come into picture. We can add the ",
        " annotator on top of the variable name for mapping a key name to it. Like this",

        " with the ",
        " file as input to it. You got an error, right? What’s it saying?",
        "So, to parse any JSON file by default, Jackson needs a mapping for all of the keys in it. Our ",

        " annotation is the one to seek help here. The variables were crowned the ",
        " annotation earlier. This one is a class level annotation meaning that you’ll have to place it on top of the ",

        "All variables in the ",

        "And the ",
        " method has only the deserialization call (",
        ")",
        "Did it stop? What do you think happened?",
        "So, Jackson uses the setter methods to deserialize JSON for non-public variables.",
        "Now you know why defining setters makes the non-public variables deserializable.",
        "You noticed the setter being called when deserializing the JSON string into a Java object. What do you think will get called when serialization happens? Can you prove that by setting an appropriate breakpoint in the ",

        "Who is calling greeting() function? Search for it throughout the codebase. Are you able to find the caller? If you are not able to find the function, who calls it?",
        "You may sometimes see this error when you run ./gradle bootRun command",
        "It means that a different instance of your server is running. You may have to kill it before restarting it using lsof -i :8081 and kill commands.",
        "Now change the function name \"public Greeting greeting()\" to “public Greeting learningisfun()”.",
        "Restart the server and see if you are able to do curl http://localhost:8081/greeting? Answer the question below.",
        "Revert the function name back to greeting() once you are done with this experiment.",
        "Did you take a look at main function?",
        "Isn’t your main function supposed to execute this single line SpringApplication.run() and then exit the program? How is that your curl command still able to get replies back if your process terminated after executing this single line?",
        "That’s where Spring’s magic comes into picture - with couple of annotations, Spring is running a a server that keeps listening on a port though your main function completed.",
        "Read a bit about",
        "@SpringBootApplication annotation and what it helps with",
        "What this line does - SpringApplication.run(RestServiceApplication.class, args)",
        "Java annotations",
        "As you can see, GreetingController.greeting(String) is the last stack frame, but you are probably not able to find anything else meaningful and you see some functions/variables containing HTTP. That is precisely the point!",
        "Here is what is happening behind the scenes:",
        "You are sending a HTTP request (http://localhost:8081/greeting) to the web server running on port 8081 either through curl or through your browser - both send the exact same request",
        "Your spring server receives this HTTP request, processes it all the way up the stack, and hands it over to some function which is marked with @GetMapping(\"/greeting\") annotation.",
        "Spring uses the @GetMapping annotation to find which function to call - so if you add one more annotation + function, you would have created one more end point and you call it by curl http://localhost:8081/newendpoint",
        "What are the other annotations you see in the code? Can you guess what they do? If you spend time now to understand what they mean, you will save hours of debugging time later when you work on a larger code base.",
        "@RestController - Tip: Assume your Java code has 1000s of classes. Which classes should your Spring search for to find @GetMapping?",
        "@RequestParam",
        "How did we tell the server to listen on 8081 when the ",
        " you referred to used 8080? Tip: grep for the \"8081\" across all files.",
        "How do you create an endpoint for a POST request? Look for annotations to do that in Spring.",
        "If you had a keen eye, you would have seen greeting() function returning a Java object.",
        "But the caller of this function, which is your curl command or your browser through indirect hops will not be able to understand Java objects. In fact they received a JSON response.",
        "How did this happen? Did you ever remember converting the Greeting java object to a JSON string?",
        "Jackson is a java library that helps you convert a Java object into JSON and back. Whenever required Spring automagically uses Jackson library to convert Java objects into JSON and back. It uses a class in Jackson library called ObjectMapper to do this. Now how do you see for yourself that this is happening? Again breakpoints are our friends.",
        "Set a breakpoint at setName() function in CreditCard.java and run the server in debug mode.",
        "Issue the curl command to the json-request endpoint.",
        "You will be hitting the breakpoint and look at the stack trace. Are you able to see ObjectMapper.readValue()?",
        "If you walk down the stack trace further, it will be obvious that Spring called it when trying to process the request.",
        "You noticed the setter being called when deserializing the JSON string into a Java object. What do you think will get called when serialization happens? Can you prove that by setting an appropriate breakpoint in Greeting class?",
        "How did Jackson know which variable to store creditCardNumber in from the JSON string? Try playing around with the input JSON and variable names in the CreditCard.java class and see if you can make out the relationship.",
        "Add @JsonIgnore on top of id field in Greeting.java",
        "See what output you get for your curl command. Try to read/reason out about the output.",
        "Can you now write a simple HTTP end-point using Spring Boot? Btw, no one writes these from scratch including the build.gradle - pick the tutorial code and keep adding more endpoints!",
        " is usually an easy way to get the overall structure of your Spring project including build.gradle dependencies.",
        "Are you now comfortable with the following annotations?",
        "@RequestParam",
        "@GetMapping, @PostMapping",
        "@RestController",
        "@SpringBootApplication",
        "Can you now explain how Spring converts JSON to Java and back?",

        "You should have a preliminary project structure set up. This structure will help you chalk out the future plans for your applications.",
        "A sample project layout is shown below (for ",
        " projects).",
        "Containerizing your app involves encapsulating or packaging up the code and all its dependencies so that it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. It allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely. With traditional methods, code is developed in a specific computing environment which, when transferred to a new location, often results in bugs and errors.",
        "Containerized applications are “isolated”; in the sense that they do not bundle in a copy of the operating system. Instead, an open source runtime engine (such as the Docker runtime engine) is installed on the host’s operating system and becomes the conduit for containers to share an operating system with other containers on the same computing system.",
        "Check out this video to learn more about containers:",
        "How are different operating systems being run on your local machine? How does Docker achieve this?",

        " here.",
        "Can you access the terminal inside a container? Check this ",
        " for how to go about doing that. Keep in mind that to run a shell inside your container, your image should have a shell installed in the first place (add commands to your Dockerfile for adding a shell or use an image that already has one installed, like ubuntu).",
        "Do you know what happens behind the scenes when you create a container? Check out this video I made to learn more about ",

        "GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.\nThese actions form the steps to a workflow. A workflow can be imagined as a fixed set of instructions (actions) that are run at some particular event occurrence. Github workflows play an important part when it comes to developing apps.\nTwo use cases for using workflows:",
        "This way, you can focus more on your application logic and less on building and deployment. Building applications on the cloud becomes a little easier with help of Github Actions.

        "There are multiple options for the choice of environment to deploy Kuberenetes on. You can choose one of the many cloud providers to host your cluster on their systems. You can also choose to host a single node (machine) cluster on your own machine.",
        "The pros for choosing an online platform:",
        "The cons:",

        " namespace.",
        "You can try the following command, with an example output shown:",
        "You have learnt about containers, understood why they are important and even built one for your app, so far. The containers ran on your local machine and utilised your system's resources. It is a good method for testing out your app and your Dockerfile but not an ideal way to deploy real applications. Some of the reasons for that are:",
        ": To make your app accessible to the outside world (your customers), you'll have to connect your container to a port that has external access. It requires knowledge of networking and a good amount of planning to execute, especially when you have multiple containers running different applications and have varied needs for communication. It would be better to have a service that standardizes exposing your apps to the public, while handling common tasks like ",
        ".",
        ": The application you're building should be accessible at all times, which means your computer must be running 24x7 to ensure a good service, but it is\nimpractical to keep your machine running throughout the day, every day.",
        ": What happens if our app becomes popular and we see a surge in client traffic?\nThe response times would be affected, and we would want to have a more powerful\nmachine or maybe multiple machines altogether depending on the situation.\nAgain, this is not possible, going by the current implementation.",
        "Going by the arguments above, you need an \"orchestration platform\" that can manage your containers across different machines (nodes), handle discovery of the different services (apps), configure the bulk of networking for you and allow you to observe and monitor for errors. These are some of the functions among the host of others that orchestration platforms support. One such, and the most popular among them, is Kubernetes.",
        "With this context, watch the following video to get a clearer picture of why Kubernetes comes into the picture and what it can do for you. Also, check out this ",
        " to gain an insight into what Kubernetes is and what it is not, as well as the following video -",

        " section that you can check out if you're unclear about the technology. Feel free to search for more resources and learn from multiple sites to get a hold on this notoriously complex subject.",
        "In the 'Requirements' section below, we'll be covering step by step, some important components of Kubernetes. The knowledge of them will help you explore more on your own and will keep from you getting intimidated by the jargon when you go ahead with building more complex applications on Kubernetes.",
        "Hopefully, by now you understand that Kubernetes makes deploying apps easy on distributed systems. There is a master and one or more workers. The master has a lot of components that allow Kubernetes to function. Among them is the ",

        "By this stage, you should know what Kubernetes is, how it is structured and what the major components are. You should be familiar with the command-line too ",
        " and should've run a few commands using it.",

        "You'll learn about the specification for the different Kubernetes objects, write one for your app and see your app running on the cluster.",
        "Up to this point, all you needed to run applications in containers was a Dockerfile and an image that you built on top of it. To run an app on Kubernetes, you need to define a configuration file for every object you wish to deploy. How is this file written and what information does it convey? Read the page ",
        " to learn extensively about writing specifications in YAML.",
        "You are familiar with running containers but the smallest units that can be deployed in Kubernetes are pods. Nothing to fret about, pods are just a group of closely related containers that share the same network (localhost). Learn more about Pods ",
        ". How do you deploy pods? It will be through applying a configuration file too, like all other objects.",

You have seen how you can take an application, containerize it using a Dockerfile, build an image for it, push it to a registry and then use the image for a container you run inside a Kubernetes cluster.

        "If you're using the Flutter framework for the first time, I'd suggest you to go online and get a basic idea of what Flutter is and how it works. It'll help you connect better with the work that you're going to be doing.",
        "We will set up the basic skeleton of the app first. If you are making a Flutter app for the first time, refer this ",
        ". After successfully setting up your new flutter project, we will now make two directories:",

        "If you're using firebase for the first time, I'd recommend you to check this ",
        " out.",
        "Make a clean structure of how your database should look like. Decide what all collections should be incorporated and then further decide the structure and fields of the documents in each collection. You should atleast have these discrete collections -",
        "we'll discuss more on how the documents in each collection should look like in the later sections.",
        "Once you've made the skeleton of the database, it's time to connect your database with the application. Check this ",
        " out for a detailed walk-through.",
        "Search for different basic flutter packages and start using them for your own testing purpose.",
        "An important thing to note while making the screens and using the variables that power your app, is state management.",
        "There are different options you can take to manage state in your application. I'll list a few of them below:",
        "The BLoC principle can be used to provide fast, reactive state management. The changes in variables are reflected almost instantly. Check widgets like stream builders etc.",
        "To handle asynchronous data, I'd recommend using widgets like futures and future builders. It however, requires some initial set-up and boilerplate code to get it running. Research articles on how to build reactive apps on Flutter and this might help you get started on it.",
        "You can transfer variables between different screens using their constructors. It is the easiest way to achieve state management.",
        "It however gets a bit complex with increasing state variables and might lead to complications, further into development.",
        " about good design practices. Learn how you can make your app more accessible and user friendly.",
        "Evaluate your choice of widgets to use; fancier ones are appealing but keep utility in mind while making the choice. Check ",
        " for some cool widgets.",
        "Start with making the Homescreen, which should look like the image below. Use ",
        " for many designing and development resources. That navigation bar can be made using the curved navigation bar package available at pub.dev. Location icon shows the current location of the device, check this ",
        " out for a detailed walk through. I recommend placing all the location service related code in a separate dart file in the functionalities directory.The horizontal scrollable list under \"Top stores nearby\" shows all the stores nearby. We'll later discuss how to query stores based on the current location.",
        "Build the discover page. It's a very basic page with a tab-bar in it, the categories which will show products of that particular category, and the Shops tab which will show the products of that particular shop. Showing products of a particular shop or catagory or both can be tackled with simple firestore queries.",
        "Build the Orders page, which again is a simple task. All you need to do is query the orders collection based on the user data, then display using a list view.",
        "Making a wishlist page. I'd recommend storing the wishlist data of a particular user in a separate field of the user document. Which can simply be a list of the product ids of all the products in the wishlist. Now you just have to show those products with simple querying in a way similar to the image below.",
        "Making the product listview page, which basically shows different query results of the products collection, like search query, shop specific query, section specific query, discount specific query etc.",
        "Product description page. Whenever we tap on a product from the query result, we are navigated to another page which displays the complete product description. Descriptions include the full size images, price, discount, sizes, variants etc. This also contains shop details which is offering that specific product.",
        "To build the cart page, I'd recommend the same to have a separate field in the user document (in users collection). This will have all the cart related information, like product ids of the products in the cart and  their quantities. The cart should look like the image below. The card layout can be achieved using the card widget and the stack widget (which gives that effect to the delete button on the top right).",
        "On tapping the place order in the cart, you should be navigated to the review cart page. This will give you a summary of your order, address details, payment details etc. Again basic querying from the firestore should do most of the work. Adding a new address or edit phone number will require you to update the user document.",
        "To implement features like \"Place Order\", basic CRUD functions can be used. Store the order data in the orders collection. Make sure to include fields like payment detailed, address, userId etc.",
        "When you open the application for the first time or after logging out you're taken to a login page. If you're a new user, you can choose to register. Further, complete its form validation and authentication error handling by enabling registration of users using email or Gmail through Firebase authentication. The login/register pages should look like these:",
        "After registration/login page, users should be redirected to the homepage. In case of error in any of the credentials, the appropriate error must be displayed.",
        "The following figure is what your user's document in firestore should look like (with respect to the parameters assigned to each user like name, address, wishlist, cart etc).",
        "At this point, the login/register pages must be made along with its error handling. Also the user must be redirected to the home screen page upon successful login. Check for all sorts of errors (email, password, password confirmation error) in the forms and give appropriate errors for each. Your cloud function should be able to make the skeleton document of the user upon registration.",
        "Try making different permutations of errors possible to test your app’s functionality.",
        "By now, you should be comfortable with handling location services. I'd recommend you to store this location data in a widget called ",
        ", which is similar to shared preferences but with subscription to the data. I'd also recommend you to use some provider widgets to make this variable available down the widget tree, this will come in handy while accessing location data in different pages.",
        "Make sure your documents in the shop collection have a field for storing the location data of the shop. The data structure that we'll be using here is a map, with two keys:",
        "Fully explore the GeoFlutterFire package and experiment with different radius for queries.",
        "Implement small features like locking the place order button if some of the products in the cart are not available nearby.",
        "We're just using the current user location for querying, see if you can change the centre of the query by passing a different geo data.",
        "Display the address from the geo data collected.",
        "Now the application will only show nearby stores or products offered by nearby stores. This includes search results, filters, sorts etc.\n",
        "By now you should have a basic application ready without the payment system. Although you can still have an option to complete the order with cash on delivery, it's always better to have an online payment system. Here, we're going to use Paytm APIs because it covers all the major online payment methods like cards, netbanking, UPIs etc.",
        "Since Paytm provides its own web based UI for the payment portal, we don't have to focus much on the UI part. Instead we'll just use a web view to simply aid the payment portal.",
        "We'll be implementing firebase cloud functions and then integrating the payment web API into those firebase functions. Further we'll be using those functions in our flutter application using web view.",
        "You should now have a working online payment system. The complete UI should look something like this:",
        "Payment web view:",
        "Transaction status page:",
        "This part is completely optional, but push notifications does give that fancy touch to the application.",
        "We'll be using Firebase cloud messaging to implement easy push notifications. Find documentation on Firebase cloud messaging ",
        ".",
        "Your application should now be equipped with a strong push-notification system. Users will now receive customized notifications at various different events.",
        "Till now, you have set up your app’s basic form. Now it’s time to amp up the app by adding some interesting features.",
        " This is an optional milestone for those who want to go that extra mile.",
        "Here are some recommendations you can adopt to make your app even better:",
        "A profile page. Here, the user can edit all the personal information like phone number, address.",
        "Automated email and texts. Use of automated emails and texts for verifications and sending useful information.",
        "Products recommendations.",
        "Use of google analytics, for better understanding the user behaviour towards the application. Check this ",
        " for more details.",
        "A proper functioning search bar.",
        "Users should have the option of sharing the product details to other users.",
        "Using advanced flutter animations to further improve the appearance of the application.",
        "Add a feature for collecting user feedbacks.",
        "Every products and shops can be rated by the users.",
        "Customised search results based on user's activity.",
        "Finally when you're all done, publish your app to the google playstore.",
        "Make necessary changes for the iOS devices and then move forward to publish it in the app store as well.",

Here we have to create a multithreading algorithm such that when we click the start button it will randomly flash multiple blocks with green light one by one, that we have  earlier created. The user must click consecutive blocks within that time framework. If the user misses the block or clicked (touched) the wrong block then the block the user touches must become red temporarily. Please see the references for a better understanding.\nAfter 60 seconds we have to show the result to the users, i.e. how many the user had missed and how many were clicked correctly.",
        "Create a class MainActivity in src by extending AppCompatActivity class. This AppCompatActivity class provides a method called onCreate() that is used when our activity or particular screens start.",

        " is the answer. By SharedPreferences, we can store and retrieve small amounts of primitive data. It can be thought of as a dictionary or a key/value pair.",
        "Where should we check SharedPreferences value?",
        "The onCreate() method which we had overridden from AppCompatActivity is the correct place to check. As we know the onCreate() method runs when our Activity instance is run. If we run our app for the first time it checks the value from our SharedPreferences and then later decides that we have to show the walkthrough or not.",
        "A splash screen is mostly the first screen of the app when it is opened. It is a constant screen that appears for a specific amount of time, generally shows for the first time when the app is launched. The Splash screen is used to display some basic introductory information such as the company logo, content, etc just before the app loads completely.",
        "For game applications to be consumable by the end-users (public) we have to create a release-ready package. An optional step before building your app for release is ",
        ". Obfuscation hides functions and classes used in the Android code to provide security against reverse engineering attempts on the app.",

        "So, this project is also divided into 3 parts:",
        "We start by settings things up for the front-end, then for database and then move towards to the back-end part.",
        "The main objective of this milestone is to make sure that you understand the basic overflow of the project. Also, you should have a code editor and apache distribution in place. With this you should be able to access the MySQL, phpmyadmin home page and your project files.",
        "Let's start ourselves from the result section!!",
        "What exactly we want from our system? Yes, you are thinking it right. We want from our system that it should take student details as input such as ",
        ", ",
        ", ",
        " (for hiding it from other students, if required) and produce his/her result as output. Make a ",
        " file with some convenient name and make a form which takes ",
        " and ",
        " as input. On submit, it should perform required SQL query(s) to obtain the result as output.\n",
        "\n",
        "But wait! From which table are we going to fetch the required data? Did we create any table in the ",
        " database? Yes, you are right, we don't have any table yet. Go ahead and create a table called ",
        ". But what should be the attributes in the table? The simplest table should have at least these following attributes -",
        "Apart from that you can add attributes if you want such as gender, mail, contact number, etc. But this should be there for proper data storing and fetching. Shouldn't it?",
        "You should be able to make a database, table and attributes with some data into it. You should also be able to get student data as input, parse it, perform search queries and output it to the user.",
        "Let's analyze our previous database from various DBMS perspectives.\n",
        "The answer to all the questions is ",
        ", why? Think about it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's suppose if some student data is changed like address, contact number, etc. Then, we have to reflect that change at all the entries in the database because there are many entries for a single unique student depends on number of subjects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, it is not looking great if we have to scale it for various classes, schools, etc. Because at the end data will become more and more redundant. Also, we can't perform other high level operations on this current database due to its not so good looking structure.",
        "You should be able to justify why this database will not be a good fit in terms of various purposes that are mentioned above. You should be able to understand what normalization is and why there is need to normalize.",
        "Let's split our original table ",
        " into various usable and manageable tables. The tables are split in a manner such that data will remain consistent.",
        "You should be able to make various tables for this database and its corresponding attributes.",
        "Now, as we have our new database structure, we definitely have to rewrite the SQL queries for student result fetching.\n",
        "\n",
        "Start from what your user will type at the front-end. We can safely assume that your user will know at least his/her Roll Id, Class Name and Section. But our user doesn't know that how the class name and section is stored in the database. Also, we as developers don't know that how users will type his/her class name and section because there are many possibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, to make it clear for both the user and you, we should give them a drop-down menu of all the classes in our database. From which table of our database we will do it? Yes, you are right from ",
        " table. User will see his/her class name along with section and in return we will store the class id.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the code for your reference.",
        "Store the roll id and class id in some variables on the redirected page after user click submit.",
        "Now, coming to the query part where we bind our above parameters and fetch student result. Result should at least contains his/her subject name (not subject id because user don't know about subject id at all), corresponding marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the query for the same.",
        "You should be able to fetch and output student result accurately by taking input as per your willingness.",
        "As said earlier this project is divided into 3 parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "We settled up things for the front-end and database, it's time to move towards the back-end part.\n",
        "\n",
        "But is there any need to develop a back-end part separately? Why this is required?\n",
        "\n",
        "Till now we have been doing our back-end part with the database. But this is not looking convenient for adding, deleting and modifying data. That's why there is a need to make a separate back-end portal where we can add/update student details like class, subject, subject combination, result and other details through a proper UI.",
        "The main motive of this milestone is to understand the concept behind making an admin portal. You should be able to design basic outline of the admin portal.",
        "Let's try to build each module (renamed option to module).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, I will explain 2 functionalities - add and update classes. Rest all are similar in nature just the SQL query changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make a form which takes all the input corresponding to each attribute in ",
        " table.",
        "On submitting the form it should perform a MySQL insert query into the ",
        " of same database.",
        "Your back-end code should resemble below code -",
        "Make a table which shows all the classes details such as serial number, class name, class section, etc. depending on your table structure.",
        "Make an extra column for each row for editing that entry in the database, attach the class id with that value.",
        "Print the existing details in form format for that class id to user using MySQL select command which user can change.",
        "After submitting form, the back-end of that page should perform MySQL update query as follows -",
        "You should able to design, code and test each module using your admin portal and ",
        " database server.",
        "Now, the need arises to secure this admin section. Why? Because otherwise students will change theirs and others results and details which in turn becomes a very serious issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two ways to secure this admin section - first is to separate this portal completely with new location and project while the second is to make it password protected. First is not actually a full proof solution. Why? Because if anyone gets to know about this portal and its location then eventually the same problem still persists. So, we will go with the second approach.",
        "Make a new table into database with attributes - ",
        " and ",
        ".",
        "Fill these values depending on the administrative team.",
        "Make a form which accepts user name and password as an input and in turns verifies from this table data.",
        "If the entries filled are correct then store these values in the session for future reference and land him to the actual admin section.",
        "The main motive of this milestone is to make admin section secure. You should be able to authenticate the person before sending him to the admin section.",
        "Now, we are at the end stage of this project. We will try to put all things together and test it. Additionally you will learn how to generate PDF with required content so that one can download and share it wherever he/she wants.",

But let's suppose we again type 'gmail.com' in the browser after sometime i.e. we are again sending a request to the server for our account access, and as before the server doesn't know anything about us.

In this task you will learn about web app servers, connecting your app to a target server and run the app on localhost to test out the app. Also the concept of API will be briefed here.",
        "You might have noticed, as and when we are adding more and more APIs, managing everything using the 'HTTP' module alone will become complicated. Even adding a single API will require us to look at the entire code and then add the new API at appropriate parts of the code. We will try to simplify that in this module.",

        "Now that we know a way legitimate users can update their profile i.e. we have implemented one private API.

This is not at all a good user experience (think how will you feel when every time you type ",
        " we have to re-enter your credentials every time). In this module we will try to fix this behaviour.",
        "The idea is that instead of sending ",
        " and ",
        " with each request, we will send ",
        " and ",
        " in the first request. The server then sends us a token which is valid for a particular duration. Now, every time we need to send a request to a private API, we will send the token instead and if the token is valid, the server will know that the user requesting the info is legitimate.",
        "It is a good idea to always send ",
        " in headers. It will help in separating the logical request with the authentication part.",
        "To test whether the ",
        " really expires or not, you can set the expiry to 1 minutes and test the same instead of waiting for it to expire after 1 hr.",
        "Remember, the information encoded with ",
        " is publicly accessible. So, never include sensitive information in your token.",
        "It is recommended to use the 3rd optional argument in ",
        " library instead of manually setting the expiry in the payload.",
        "Though at the end it will add a few arguments in the payload only. It has a few advantages -",
        "After you have successfully implemented the APIs, the app behaviour will look something like below -",
        "We have almost finished our backend APIs. A few things to solve for -",
        "In this module we will primarily fix these 2 issues.",
        "The app should behave like before after you have successfully implemented the APIs -",
        "You might have seen several services which send you an email whenever you login or perform some actions on the application.\nSuppose you want to build similar functionality for your application. As you might have noticed, we might need to send email in a lot of use cases. So, let's build a separate API which just sends an email. Everyone should not be able to access this internal API. That API should be accessed only by us and by our other APIs. How do you prevent other users accessing this API?",
        "In this module you will learn the basic idea of building an API which can only be accessed internally or by us.",
        "Everytime you call ",

        "Who doesn't like playing games? Do you want to create your own game? Get started with a simple game project using Slack bot API to interact with the workspace members and get to know them better.",
        "Slack was created in August of 2013 by Stewart Butterfield, Eric Costello, Cal Henderson, and Serguei Mourachov and stands for “Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge.” Slack began as a way for the team of Glitch (then a massive multi-player online game) to communicate between each other. Even as the team realized that Glitch was an Adobe flash based game at a time the market had moved towards mobile app-based games, they found that the internal software they developed could be used to help teams collaborate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, they launched it as a set of cloud based tools to make communication at work better. Currently Slack has 11+ million daily users. So, to make the workflow easy and make some automation, there are many bots available for Slack.\n",
        "\n",

        "After few minutes (may be after 12 hours) we are going to reveal truths and lie to all the channel members.",
        "By the end of this milestone, you'll be able to notify the channel members for the new joining member and ask them to guess his lie. As soon as they guess, they will get a private message in the channel about correctness of their choice. In addition to this, you'll be reveling the answer to the channel members after sometime.",

        "The purpose of chat bots is to support and scale business teams in their relations with customers. It could live in any major chat applications like Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Text Messages, etc. Chatbot applications streamline interactions between people and services, enhancing customer experience.

In this project, we would be building an extensive Chatbot service, to which you can talk to. And talking to a chatbot wouldn't be business-driven. It would just be casual conversations. Further, on top of it, the chatbot would also be recommending songs to the user based on the tone of the user. This song recommendation feature employs the use of ",

        " API.",
        "You would have seen here also that we were only able to find 2 songs corresponding to the ",
        " tag. So, instead of using the tags returned by the Emotional API, we can map them using the mapping defined earlier above.",
        "Now, once a user would click on a particular song, we also need to recommend similar songs to that particular song. This can also be done using the last.fm's ",
        " API using the track and the artist of the song.",
        "By now, you have a complete system and a good understanding of the project's flow, which is satisfied by the above requirements.",
        "Once you have understood the complete flow, you can do whatever you want now. You can go forward with building a command-line interface that collects all these things and does them. Or you can build a separate Flask/Django server that can do the above steps as a part of an API or a Web Page.",
        "As a part of this milestone, we would be continuing with building a Django/Flask server.",
        "Building the following API's",
        "We can make a template inside your Django/flask app which has a page similar to this:",
        "Here, on the left, I have the songs recommended to the user, and on the right-hand side are the songs which were recommended based on one of the songs which I clicked on.",
        "Further, the emotion of the chat is shown at the top",
        "Context of the Cakechat Chatbot is: at max last 3 conversations.",
        "You can do this milestone in your own style.",
        "Further, you can learn about docker and build a docker-compose file that provides all the services in one place.",
        "By the end of this milestone, you would have a working chatbot system with a good UI that recommends songs to the user along with chatting."

        "First we set up the environment and ",
        " and do a low level implementation (Proof of Concept) of the components involved in the project. For this we are going to automate the login process to get started.",
        "You may go through ",
        " as well for dependency installation.\nIn this example Firefox has been used as the browser but you are free to use any browser of choice; the only aspect that varies is the change in web driver packages for each browser.",
        "There are some nice to have settings like profiles and options you can go through in ",
        "Example:",
        "Install ",
        " and all other necessary packages",
        "Explore how ",
        " and ",
        " works.",
        "Import all necessary libraries in the script.",
        "Open Instagram login page using driver. Use driver.get(url) to open instagram login page.",
        "Checkout unique identifiers for the input fields login and passwords.",
        "Explore how ",
        " help locating various elements in a web page.",
        "Examples:",
        "Discover login, password and submit elements and interact with them to achieve sign in. Use driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath) to find the elements and use input_element.send_keys(“text”) to send text in the input boxes. Use submit_element.click() to achieve click action.",
        "The idea of this milestone is that you should explore how a web page is structured and how to inspect various components of a webpage like input fields, text, buttons etc. before interacting with them.\nThen to achieve automated login activity with just a few lines of code.\n",
        "When we open the explore page we need to click on the first post to get started with the crawling. After that we need to click on the like button to like the post and click on the next icon to advance to further posts. At this stage we need to store the URL of the images/videos in a metadata csv along with other attributes like profile name, number of likes, and comments etc, to be able to process it later. Further if we need to comment as well, we can use send_keys function in selenium to simulate typing by a user. Here we can store some hard coded messages in an array in a json file to be loaded at time of running and randomly publishing comments from this array.",
        "Alternatively, we can also use ML to detect sentiment of the post using the post description text/other comments to further improve it. But for basic proof of concept we will stick to either hard coded responses or duplicate other comments. Further we can follow a profile using the following button. After following a page we can also redirect to that page and like other sets of posts on that page as well.",
        "Now, to prevent thrashing and throttling at instagrams servers, we need to limit our requests for that we need to put sleep of random time at various stages of our script. Also, instead of crawling just the explore page generically, we can also crawl particular tags as well.",
        "Open various starter links for explore page/ tags page/ profile page using driver.get, note here while using driver.get function our page might reload and we can lose reference to previously stored elements in variables.",
        "Explore element ",
        " and ",
        " functionality to interact with buttons. This might be needed for two reasons, one selenium can't interact with an element if it's not in the view, and secondly, in modern web pages content loads dynamically, so scrolling down may trigger loading of additional content. We can also achieve scrolling by running javascript functions using python as shown below.",
        "The idea of this milestone is that you should explore how to interact with the webpage and automate various interactions like clicking and typing which can be done using selenium. Also, it will also help to grasp the concept of rate limiting and throttling and how to prevent it.",
        "The automation process should be like this -",
        "In this task we will use ",
        " functionality from ",
        " library to fetch posts from Instagram's server. While the automation is running it can encounter various ",
        " for which we need to handle them using pythons; and this is called exception handling. We also need to log these errors to further develop the script.",
        "The metadata (consisting of pictures, videos, comments mainly) are collected so that they can be subjected to some ML /DL models from which you can further advance this project by gaining analysis reports, like sentiment/emotion analysis, auto-reply and much more.",

        "Add  the functionality to parse exponents as assignments. Examples of such are:",
        "Validate whether the literals on the right hand side of ",
        " are numerical.",
        "Valid numeric literals are:  0.1e10, -01.1e-10, 0xFF(hexadecimal representation), 0xaF(hexadecimal representation), 0.34, 00, 0088",
        "Invalid numeric literals are: 1u, .3, 3e0.1(exponents cannot have decimal numbers), 1f, 1000LL, 100L",
        "Add validation for variable initialization using another variable.",
        "For example, if we have ",
        " followed by ",
        ", the two statements are valid since ",
        " is a numeric value and ",
        " implies that ",
        ". Also, ",
        " was encountered before ",
        ". The order plays a crucial role here.",
        "If it would have been ",
        " followed by ",
        ", then the first statement would be invalid, since we didn’t encounter ",
        " yet, and hence we don’t have it’s value.",
        "The input can be taken from the CLI. The program needs to process the input and output the resultant value of all variables, in case of correct inputs, and will output ERROR details in case of invalid statements.",
        "On completion of this milestone, we’ll have a basic interpreter in place, which can interpret variable assignments of numeric data. By interpret, we mean that your program will parse strings, validate the values and store them in respective variables.",
        "Every programming language has a set of variable conventions. These conventions help in maintaining uniform standards across multiple programs written by programmers.",
        "Add validation for proper variable naming conventions. Many programming languages have similar rules for naming their variables. For example, in C++ some of the valid identifiers are shyam, _max, j_47, name10, etc. and some invalid identifiers are: 4xyz, x-ray, abc 2, etc.",
        "Your program should print ERROR messages on encountering invalid identifiers.",
        "In case of invalid identifiers:",
        "Can you add the feature to your program to inform details of why an identifier is invalid?",
        "Can you add a feature such that your program provides suggestions for identifier naming?",
        "Your program should be able to differentiate between valid and invalid variable names.",
        "Add the functionality to evaluate arithmetic expressions and validate the same.",
        "Implement arithmetic operations such as  addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) and exponentiation(**) using two operands. Your Interpreter should be able to evaluate the below expressions:",
        "Evaluate infix expressions.",
        "Operator precedence should be handled.",
        "Check for parenthesis match.",
        "Valid :   ",

        " would be invalid if we’ve not encountered ",
        " before",
        " is invalid as ",
        " is invalid",
        "In case of arithmetic expressions as variable assignments, validate whether the right hand side of a variable assignment statement is a valid expression or not. For example:",
        " is valid if the interpreter has already encountered ",
        ", ",
        " and ",
        "Similarly the following expression should work if the variables of the expression have already been encountered",
        " will be invalid if either f or g weren’t encountered before this statement",
        " is invalid, as ",
        " is an invalid token",
        "Suppose we have ",
        " and we’ve already encountered ",
        ", ",
        " and ",
        ",  it’s still invalid because ",
        " is invalid, since exponents are always given as whole numbers",
        "A proper ERROR message should be displayed on encountering invalid expressions.",
        "Can you answer the following question:",
        "Implement all the above arithmetic operations for arbitrary precision (say 1000 digits precision).",
        "By the end of this milestone, your program should be able to do the following:",
        "Evaluate arithmetic expressions",
        "Validate arithmetic expressions",
        "Efficiency plays a vital role in software usability. On completion of the earlier milestones, we have an interpreter in place with basic functionality. But, it can be made more efficient by making adjustments to some micro components such as better variable accessibility and efficient calculations.",
        "Note: This Milestone is not mandatory, but it improves the performance of your software.",
        "The key value pair of assignment statements form perfect lookup table entries. After validating expressions enter them in the lookup table(use a hashing based data structure). The idea is that you should be able to look up values based on variable names.",
        "For better complexity of multiplication, use the Karatsuba algorithm.",
        "For better complexity of division, use the Newton–Raphson division.",
        "Find a way to perform fast exponentiation.",
        "For more curious readers: ",
        "By the end of this milestone, you should have an efficient interpreter in place with basic functionalities.",
        "Great job!",
        "Now that you’ve successfully completed all the milestones, you can show off your work to your peers! Go on and publish your new piece of software on GitHub and get some nice green pixels!",

        "Understand what REST APIs are",
        "Understand how to make REST API calls",
        "REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Don’t worry - no one’s gonna ask you the meaning of each word :)",
        "API stands for Application Programming Interface, and unfortunately, people will ask you the meaning of each word here. An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. You don’t go into a cafe and walk straight into the kitchen to tell the chef what you wanna eat. The waiter does that for you, and that’s exactly what an API is - with the client being you, the customer and any resource that can send data, being the chef.",
        "Now, these APIs have different styles, or in more formal terms - conventions and architectures about how they are used.",
        "REST APIs are those APIs which follow the guidelines set by the REST architecture. They follow a client-server model where one software program sends a request and the other responds with some data. REST APIs commonly use the HTTP protocol to send requests & receive responses.",
        "How an API request differs from a usual HTTP request for a webpage, is in terms of the data returned. HTTP requests for webpages return HTML, CSS & JavaScript files which are rendered by the browser and displayed to the user. But, in the case of APIs, the request can be for any data (not just webpage) and the response is read by the requesting program which interprets the data.",
        "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation - how cryptic :| ) is a standard format that is easily \"understandable\" by applications and can be handled well in most languages. So the data format in REST is usually JSON. For example, an Android app can effortlessly utilize data sent by a Node.js server. XML is another popular format for data transfer between applications.",
        "The following video will give you a quick overview of REST API.",
        "The APIs shown in the video might require authentication when you try it out (Authentication is done so that a spammy bot(aka, hacker) doesn’t send ten quadrillion requests to a resource and blast its servers out. It can be caught and stopped)",
        "Excited about trying this out on your own? Use ",
        " or find one you like from ",
        "Which ones did you try out? (You can try out a Chrome extension like ",
        " to format the JSON response in your browser window)",
        "As we discussed earlier, REST API calls are made on top of the HTTP protocol. We can analyse the network packets during the API calls to confirm this using Wireshark.\n",
        "\n",
        " is a popular network analysis tool to capture network packets and display them at a granular level. Once these packets are broken down, you can ",
        " them for real-time or offline analysis.",
        "The client sends a HTTP ",
        " request (line 8) to the server. The server responds with a ",
        " status code and JSON data on line 10. (API request was made to ",
        ", see ",
        ")",
        "Do note, REST is one architectural pattern used, NOT the only one. There are some has beens, like SOAP and some new kids on the block, like GraphQL. These patterns differ in the ways in which they ask for data, send data, and how they enforce these practices. You’ll find links to them in the Takeaways section - so do reach there ASAP.",

        " character is the query parameter. It specifies the search criteria for the resource. Here, the locations returned get filtered by the value of the query parameter, ",
        " we provide.",
        "For every API request, the corresponding API response also contains HTTP headers that the server sends back along with the data requested. See if you can answer some questions based on these response headers.",

        "In the fast-moving, effort-intense environment that the average person inhabits, It’s a frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course, even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good meal every once in a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it’s a commonly understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect of the lifestyle one leads.",
        "Now, imagine a scenario where a person has newly moved into a new location. They already have certain preferences, certain tastes. It would save both the student and the food providers a lot of hassle if the student lived close to their preferred outlets. Convenience means better sales, and saved time for the customer.",
        "Food delivery apps aside, managers of restaurant chains and hotels can also leverage this information. For example, if a manager of a restaurant already knows the demographic of his current customers, they’d ideally want to open at a location where this demographic is at its highest concentration, ensuring short commute times to the location and more customers served.If potential hotel locations are being evaluated, a site that caters to a wide variety of tastes would be ideal, since one would want every guest to have something to their liking.",

        "Now that we have our data, we need to understand it. A good way to do this is by visualising the data via graphs. Graphs help us quickly get a sense of the data, and are a much more user-friendly way of understanding data as compared to reading thousands of rows of data!",

        "You should have a boxplot of your cleaned dataset, and a list of insights pertaining to the dataset.",
        "K Means Clustering will help us group locations based on the amenities located around them. For example, a location with a high amount of shops nearby will be labeled \"Amenity Rich\" while a location with less amenities will be labeled \"Amenity Poor\". Similar locations will be grouped (clustered) together. (Check the references for a more formal explanation!)",
        "Run the KMeans Clustering Algorithm and figure out the best value for K, which we will use later.",
        "Note that here we are applying K means first on the dataset of the general population, which will help us organise the population into groups. Further down the line, we will apply K means again on a different dataset.",
        "Income is usually a reliable way to differentiate people, as different classes of people tend to have different habits.",
        "You should have the optimum K value for the dataset, and the parameters on which the clusters are differentiated.",
        "Now that we know the best K value for our population, we need to get geolocational data from the Foursquare API to find these people some accomodation!",

        "Note that here we are applying K means on the dataset of the locations which we chose, which will help us find the best location for each population group that we found in Task 3.",
        "Now that you have the results, try and make sense of them - what sort of person will live in what cluster? Are there any particular criteria/demographics that go well together? Knowing all this will help you present your findings if you were doing a case study as a Data Scientist!",

        "This can lead to inconsistent behavior.",
        "Results in code duplication which makes maintenance difficult. Whenever a new change is to be implemented related to the user preferences, the developer needs to work out the changes for each of the handlers separately.",
        "We saw what encapsulation is in the ",
        " section earlier. Is our current implementation encapsulated?",
        "Nope. The handlers are triggering an update to the country and language fields directly. Each one is implementing its own validation logic.",
        "Repeating code is never good. It is better to have common methods in one place, which can be used by all other methods.",
        "What is the best place to put a method?",
        "A method should be placed closed to its relatives. If you are using classes, all methods that work on the data fields in that class should be within the class itself, making it a cohesive unit. This is precisely what encapsulation offers!",
        "The main advantage is this. The data fields of the class will not be modified from outside methods. This puts the state of the class object in the hands of the methods it exposes. So, the object stays in control. It is its own master.",
        "Note: In Java, the ",
        " access specifier can be used to hide the data fields from outside access.",
        "We have answered the ",
        " about encapsulation, let’s look at the ",
        " in the next section.",
        "Let’s see how to re-design our current implementation to satisfy encapsulation.",
        "We have an Encapsulation based implementation of our country-language validation inside the ",
        " file as the ",
        " class. Class? Yeah, we’ve enclosed everything related to user preferences in a class. Let’s check the methods provided by the class",
        " - empty constructor for the class i.e, we’ll be able to create objects without passing any parameters. But, isn’t ",
        " a parameter? Hmm, not really! ",
        " denotes the object itself.",
        " - constructor that takes in parameters. We can see that ",
        " is a mandatory parameter and the other two defaults to ",
        " if not provided",
        " - wraps our validation logic which the handlers will now be utilizing for updating the user’s language preference",
        " - utility method to update user’s country preferences",
        " - stores the user preferences to the ",
        " file. The leading ",
        " in the method name denotes the method isn’t to be used outside of the class.",
        " - Hidden method to read current user preferences from the ",
        " file.",
        "You might be thinking, \"Why are the variable names starting with ",
        ", don’t you like normal names?\"",
        "This is just a naming convention in python, which signifies that the field is not supposed to be accessed directly from outside the class.",
        "If you check our new handler implementations, you’d see that both of them are using the same method, ",
        " of the ",
        " class to update the user's language preference. The handler doesn't need to worry about how the user language is updated anymore.",
        "Run the ",
        " file & verify the contents of the user_preferences.json file is correct",
        "What are the different places we now need to check when the update language feature doesn’t work as expected? Just one, right?",
        "Not only was code duplication avoided but also the developers working on the handlers can do their job and let the class methods (who know their own class variables better), do their job.",
        "The new feature is clearly becoming a hit. With data available for the user’s country & preferred language, we are able to provide a much more personalized experience to the users. It’s time to open up our application to a much wider audience - add support for 2 more countries and 4 more languages with specific validation.",
        "With the encapsulation based code, isn’t it much easier to implement than before?",
        "Welcome to the encapsulation enlightened world! :)",
        "Practical scenarios",
        "Data gets passed between method/function calls all the time. With increasing complexity, we will end up passing more and more variables between methods which are related to a common cause. It is best to model these variables as a single object and pass the object between the methods. Encapsulation ensures only the necessary sections of the object are modifiable across all the methods.",
        "Simple example: Passing variables to represent a matrix - a 2D array, number of rows, number of columns - can be replaced by a matrix object.",
        "Another example: A product for sale has these fields - price, category, discount percentage, vendor name etc. These can be modeled as an object with methods to change the price, discount etc.",
        "Having encapsulation ensures that situations like renaming of a variable doesn’t impact the external methods that are using the class method to get or set this variable.",
        "Summary of Encapsulation",
        "Encapsulation is achieved by the object making its state (data fields) restricted to private access. External objects cannot access them directly. They can only access the state through the methods exposed by the objects.",
        " is it useful? - Sets the stage to restrict access to data fields and keeps the object in control of what fields can be modified and how. Ensures consistent behavior across users of this object.",
        " to apply? - While designing any class that has data fields and needs methods to be supported for their reading or modification.",
        " to apply? - Provide public methods for reading or updating the data fields in the class only as needed. E.g. get() or set() methods.",
        "What is the drawback if we don’t use encapsulation? - Duplication of code. Low maintainability. Inconsistent behavior. Difficult to test. Possible inappropriate access/modification from external methods.",
        "Language specific notes",
        "In Python, we name our variables starting with dunders(",
        ") to explicitly mark them as hidden variables as Python doesn’t support this behaviour by default.",
        "More OOPS aligned programming languages like C++/Java/Ruby provide access modifiers like public/private that we can utilize effectively to achieve encapsulation. Here, getter/setter methods are portals to the class state.",
        "General encapsulation notes",
        "Restricts direct access to data members of a class.",
        "Fields are set to private if language supports it, else treated as such",
        "Each field has a getter and setter method",
        "Getter methods return the field",
        "Setter methods let us change the value of the field",
        "Does prefixing variables with dunders (",
        ") in Python like we did really make them hidden from outside access? Is there some way to still access & manipulate them?",

        "Execute this and see the output",
        "The ",
        " class contains elements and methods related to all 3 message types, but only some of them are required by the clients based on the message type. Even if a client (e.g. android_client_handler.py) wants only a text message, they will get all other fields in the Message object which they wouldn’t use.",
        "Extending this code with more message types will add more elements and methods in the ",
        " class, making it difficult to maintain.",
        "Another manner to go about supporting new types of messages will be to create different classes for each. Each one takes care of a single message type. Yeah! Something like carbon-copies of our ",
        " class. Each of these classes will have all the common fields & their methods as well as fields & methods specific to that message type. As the classes will only be having fields & methods they absolutely require, there won’t be any unused functionality.",

        "Lot of repeated code across these classes. Change needed in one of the common fields or methods would mean modifying all these classes. Low maintainability and low extensibility.",

        "However, the tech lead is not fully satisfied with these proposals. He thinks they are not easily maintainable. Something is missing here and they can do better.",
        "Yes, this situation is just right for Inheritance.",

        "The Clients get only the fields and methods for the message type they are interested in by creating an object of the child class. This is in contrast to getting all fields by creating an object of a large single Message class, as was the case with Proposal 1 earlier.",

If the page size is 4KB, dividing memory address by page size gives us the page number as 0x400 with 4 as remainder which is the number of locations from the starting of the page where our memory address resides. We check the process’ page table and find that page number 0x400 is mapped to page frame number 0x10.

        ". In short, pages are stored in page frames. Pages & page frames are identified by unique numbers. Any page will be allocated a complete page frame in the RAM and hence all memory addresses in a page will be contiguous in physical memory as well. Now, when the physical memory is depleted and the OS needs to allocate memory to a process, it can choose to ",
        " data from a frame to disk. The page table of the process whose data was just swapped is also updated to show the frame is in disk and has information about the location on disk where it was swapped.",
        "Ok, cool stuff. But, how exactly is a memory address mapped? Does the OS use a hashing algorithm or what?",
        "With virtual memory in place and memory grouped into pages, OS is free to choose any vacant page frame in the physical memory to store a ",
        " content. Let’s say our process queries for data in its memory location 0x00400004. If the page size is 4KB, dividing memory address by page size gives us the page number as 0x400 with 4 as remainder which is the number of locations from the starting of the page where our memory address resides. We check the process’ page table and find that page number 0x400 is mapped to page frame number 0x10. As our memory address is 4 locations after the first address in the page, we find data in the 4th address after the first in the page frame as well.",

        "You are now running a REST API server which will respond back to your API requests.",
        "It is recommended that you become familiar with the file and folder structure before you begin. Spend some time opening files and simply reading the code. It is not necessary to understand what is happening. It is to be able to remember the files, classes and perhaps method names that are used. Let’s take a look at some of the important files:",
        " The main file, serves as the entry point to the application. It also has the code which starts the spring backend server.",
        " Controller file that intercepts the incoming requests, processes them and sends it onwards to the service layer.",
        " Files in the service layer. These two files simply forward the request to the forum’s repository layer.",
        " Repository layer files that issue queries to MongoDB. It also takes care of converting objects from entity objects to DTO objects.",
        " It is the class through which interaction with the database occurs as you will soon see.",
        "The forum controller prints the \"Hello World\" output but also a statistic on the number of users in the forum. Dig into the controller class and see where this number came from.",
        "Open the file - ",
        " and look for this snippet of code.",
        "What is happening is that when we request the /stats url, it is intercepted by the method above and the output is sent to the browser. So the natural question to ask is where are the stats coming from?",
        "The line responsible for that is ",
        ". A quick peek into ",
        " will lead you to ",
        ". This is where you can see the code that talks to the database.",
        "This time, the line of interest is ",
        ".",
        "And once more, you can take a quick peek into the ",
        " file to see the implementation, except for one problem… There’s no implementation!",
        "Unlike the other times where there was an interface and a corresponding implementation, for the repository class, there is only an interface. Where does the implementation come from?",
        ". The interface acts as a marker to help you capture the ",
        " you need to work with. And the ",
        " is parsed by Spring to generate the query internally. If you observe the interface, it extends ",
        ".",
        "The \"types\" here are ",
        " and ",
        ". ",
        " is the entity to manage (The Entity is a presentation of the row or document in the table or collection in your database). ",
        " is the id of the managed entity object, in this case it is an integer. Also note, the entity class ",
        " be marked with ",
        " for MongoDB to signify to Spring that it must manage it.",
        "The other big advantage is that this repository pattern is an abstraction for different databases. This means, you can use a technology specific abstraction for different databases. The one you are using is ",
        ", but you can use ",
        " for relational databases such as MySQL.",
        "The method name you have invoked is the ",
        " method Spring Data knows you have invoked the findAll() method, from the mongo repository class, then it generates the appropriate query automatically and sends it to the database that the server connects to using the details in ",
        " file.",
        "Phew! That’s a lot of things that are happening under the hood.",
        "That is precisely the advantage of using this pattern. Spring manages the hard work of query generation, connecting and disconnecting to databases and so on so that you can simply invoke one method and continue to focus on the business logic.",
        "So much for the introduction. Next, you will see how to handle querying using this powerful abstraction.",
        "Spring Data offers multiple projects under the same umbrella to connect to various data sources. You can find the entire list here: ",
        "Spring Data Mongo Repository reference: ",
        "Is the method name ",
        " fixed? What if you use ",
        ", can you try it out and see if it works? Why or why not? Can you search the documentation for ",
        " and see how it relates to ",
        "?",
        "Entities managed for Mongo DB must use ",
        ". A \"document\" is a term specific for MongoDB, so does this mean a data source backed by a different technology uses a different annotation? Can you try to figure out what this would be for MySQL?",
        "Previously, you looked at getting all users in the forum and got the count. What if you wanted to select only some users?",
        "Since it has been established that the querying occurs by observing the method name and parameters, it stands to reason that if we tweak these two things, Spring will be able to generate different queries.",
        "Let’s look at the code in the ",
        " once again.",
        "Look at the method this time. From the ",
        " interface, the signature is:",
        "Let’s break this down:",
        "The return type is a List",
        "The method name is different. The query parsing mechanism strips the prefix ",
        " and parses the rest of the method name. The ",
        " is a delimiter by which the rest of the criteria for the underlying query is determined. Generally, this criteria will be the ",
        ". In this case, this is \"username\".",
        "To use multiple properties, operators to concatenate the properties are used, such as ",
        " as well as ",
        ".",
        "So far, it has been established that username is the criteria, but you need a value for this username upon which the User collection can be scanned. This value is provided in the method parameter.",
        "With that, Spring has enough information to generate the query and send it to MongoDB.",
        "Once the user document is retrieved, posts are extracted out of it and returned to the service layer.",
        "If you want to observe the output, you can request the url from the browser preview feature as you did to get the forum stats in module 1. What is the request url? ",
        ": Look at the controller methods and try to figure it out from there.",
        "What if the entity property is longer in words? For example, let’s assume there the entity has properties: ",
        " which signifies city of birth, ",
        " which is for date of birth and ",
        " which is for current city of residence. How will you put this in a method that uses all three as criteria? Is the method name ",
        " correct?",
        ": All the method parsing algorithm needs is a way to differentiate between the criteria. The default is to use camel case as a delimiter, which means you have to use a different delimiter in the above method name. How to do this?",
        "The repository method returns ",
        ", but the username is generally unique in a forum. How would you change the method to return a single user document? Can you try it out?",
        "In this form, the method name is not parsed. Instead, you add a ",
        " annotation to the method and specify a MongoDB json query string.",
        "For example, in the previous task, you used",
        "as the method name which needed to be parsed. Using the query annotation route, its form can be changed to something that looks like this:",
        "Let’s break this down:",
        "The first thing to be observed is that the method name does not play a part here in generating the query here.",
        "The ",
        " in the json query string is the entity property, and the ",
        " is the value you want to give to the criteria. This value is taken from the method parameter. The \"0\" here indicates that it is the first parameter in the query method that should be used as the value. Similarly, you would expect to write ",
        ", ",
        " and so on should more method parameters by used.",
        "With the ",
        " annotation, you gain more power as it is more expressive but the tradeoff for this is that you lose the ease and convenience of the query methods from before. The other tradeoff is that there is a tighter coupling between the query and the underlying technology of the data store as we must know the query semantics of the store.",
        "Let’s take a look at the implementation of the use case where this is utilized.",
        "The objective is to get users whose posts contain the string \"cricket\" in their post content. To do this, you need to search for the string inside an array of posts for every user document. This is not straightforward to do using a query method. But we can turn to the expressive power of ",
        " annotation to solve this problem.",
        "The code in the repository service is as follows:",
        "And the repository method with the annotation is:",
        "Of course, you are not limited to regex operators. You are only limited by the query capabilities offered by mongo. Thus the method annotation form offers pretty much the full expressive power of querying directly on MongoDB.",
        "How many posts contain the word \"ipl\"?",
        "Can you try searching for posts that have a substring ",
        " order it by the time of post creation?",
        "The third form of querying the database that Spring Data offers is MongoTemplate. With each increasing step you have taken, you have traded convenience for expressiveness and flexibility. MongoTemplate is the most powerful form, allowing you to construct dynamic, ad-hoc queries which offer granular control over the other forms.",
        "Let’s go through a previous use case - get users by username.",
        "Let’s break down this usage:",
        "There are three objects here: ",
        " object, ",
        " object, ",
        " object. The ",
        " and ",
        " objects have a fluent style API which makes it easy to chain together criteria and queries programmatically. This offers one big advantage over the other forms: You can construct queries ",
        " Previously, you were effectively limited to \"hard-coded\" queries which means if you query had to be changed based on some system condition, it was not possible unless there was already another query method that could be selected. With this chainable API, you can construct queries in an ad-hoc fashion.",
        "Once the query is created, mongoTemplate can be used to execute the query. Notice the ",
        " method. If you remember your mongo queries, it should be familiar. There are a whole host of methods ",
        " has to help you beside this one.",
        "The answer as always is: It depends. If your queries do not change much, or are relatively straightforward you may prefer query methods. If you want full flexibility to write your own ad-hoc queries, ",
        " may be more preferable. You could also go for a mixed approach through proper layering and decoupling, where you could start off with the relatively simple repository query methods and then start adopting MongoTemplate as and when more expressive queries are required."

Your code will be using the components others are working on.",

        "We have many product teams that have to deal with multiple types of configuration. All of them have similar implementations that utilize the ",
        " class methods, for reading/storing specific configuration from/to disk as JSON. For example, the Inventory team’s config handler is ",

        " from ",
        ". Similarly, for the write method as well.",
        "The Logistics team has shifted to XML based configuration, while the Inventory and Vendor teams stay with JSON.",
        "Let’s also check how the implementation of the Logistics team changed in ",

        "Compare the contents of ",
        " file, that was just created with the ",
        " file from our earlier implementation. Same configuration, different format, right?",
        "The above design works but has some disadvantages.",
        "Adding support for another file type will involve creating even more methods in config_manager.py, making it cluttered. For now, we have renamed previous methods and added two new methods.",
        "The Clients using this code need to make corresponding changes to method names and parameter values, which might be getting invoked in multiple places.",
        "With the implementation in the previous milestone, we see that new methods were put into the config_manager class. This keeps the implementation in one place. However, with more and more methods being added, the config_manager is catering to multiple use cases which are better off in their own class. Having their own class will make it easier to maintain and have clear responsibilities.",
        "Also, the users explicitly need to use method names based on the file type and are no longer generic. If they are making this call in multiple places, users would need to replace all occurrences, if they need to change the file type.",
        "Abstraction addresses these shortcomings by clearly defining a common method signature. Separate classes can implement the same method but internally read the file type of choice. From a user perspective, the methods don’t change based on file type and it is easy to change from one type to another with minimal changes.",
        "Let’s go through an Abstraction driven design for this requirement to see how it is better.",
        "We had a couple of shortcomings:",
        " class is catering to multiple use cases",

        " are to be changed in all places they’re used.",
        "This redesigned version can be found inside the ",
        " directory.",
        "To combat the first issue, we go with an abstract class ",
        " inside ",
        ". Abstract class? Yeah, we won’t provide any implementation in this class, just the method names. Other classes will then implement these methods based on the file types they need to support.",
        "Let’s look at what the method definitions are trying to say",
        " - sets an abstract method ",
        " which takes a single parameter, ",
        " denoting the configuration file name. No, ",
        " isn’t another parameter but just denotes object of the ",
        " class itself",
        " - defines the abstract method ",
        " which takes two parameters, configuration file name & the configuration data to be written to the config file.",
        "Now, the fancy annotation ",
        " along with the ",
        " method is required as Python doesn’t support abstract classes by default.",
        "Now we have the method signature required for reading & writing configuration laid out clearly. Each configuration file type can be supported by a subclass of the ",
        " class which will implement the specific read/write functionality of that type.",
        "You can see that we have a class each for dealing with the JSON & XML configurations. Let’s check the  ",
        " file.",
        "Some points we can comprehend from the code",
        "The ",
        " class is a subclass of the ",
        " abstract class",
        "It implements both of the abstract methods defined in ",
        "Similarly, we have the implementation for the XML type configuration in ",
        "All done, right? Hmm, Not really!",
        "Our earlier implementation had one more drawback - we were dealing with the issue of having to change method names and parameter values in all previous implementations, whenever support for a new config file type was added. This made the code harder to maintain.",
        "How did we deal with this in our new implementation based on Abstraction?",
        "Taking a look at the Logistics team’s implementation in ",
        "As the Logistics team moved to using XML, they are creating an object of the ",
        " class and it’s methods for reading & writing configuration as XML type.",
        "What would the Logistics team need to do if they were having second thoughts to go back to JSON itself? They’d need to just change ",
        " to an object of type ",
        " instead of  ",
        ". Done!",
        "You can use the below command for running ",
        "New requirements have come in, to add support for storing configuration in CSV files and also in a Database.",
        "How easy or difficult is it (with the abstraction based design) to add this support?",
        "Practical scenarios",
        "The Java Virtual Machine is an abstraction. Your code can use the exact same java methods irrespective of whether your code will run on Linux or Windows or any other OS. Underneath, a lot of things will change depending on the OS, which the user doesn’t need to know.",
        "You can use a simple API call to fetch weather data or stock prices. These API abstract out the internal complexities of how it is implemented.",
        "Software libraries are good examples of abstraction. They tell you the methods you can use without telling you how they are implemented.",
        "Summary of Abstraction",
        "It separates the method signature from its implementation.",
        "Closely related classes can separate out common fields/methods into a different class and reuse that class.",
        " is it useful? - To the implementers of the class, it is useful since it provides them with the flexibility to change things as long as the method signatures don’t change. For the users, it keeps them from getting exposed to anything other than the method signatures they need to know, reducing complexity.",
        " to apply? - Use a smaller set of public methods",
        "What is the drawback if we don’t use abstraction? - Low maintainability because responsibilities are not clearly differentiated. Higher Complexity with larger code bases because many objects interact with others and it becomes difficult to add functionality without impacting others.",
        "Language specific notes",
        "In Java, ",
        " classes provides total abstraction and ",
        " classes provide partial abstraction",

        "Exception handling, at first, might seem like an additional burden. However, the real benefit kicks in when the project becomes large and it becomes hard to \"remember\" all your code. This is also the case when you are working as a team and different components of the project will be written by multiple developers, who can all make changes independently.",
        "Let’s look at an example to see the value of this.",
        "What would you feel if you saw this screen when you eagerly typed in some query on Quora?",
        "For someone who has seen a lot of error traces and loves this, the next step would be to go through the adventure of figuring out what the error is saying. But, for a layman user, this won’t make any sense and the user will leave the page. Not only did the user not get what they wanted, but was also not given any information to figure out what went wrong.",
        "How would the user emotion be if the screen was like this?",
        "Here, the user is shown a much more \"usable\" message that communicates what happened. Users would appreciate this and try out the suggestions mentioned here.",
        "Exception Handling allows developers to recover from such errors and handle it gracefully with a clear message to users.",
        "The images are only representative and not real website images from Quora",
        "Though digging into stack traces and finding the root cause of an error will be exciting sometimes, you wouldn’t want to deal with it on a frequent basis. Debugging code takes time and effort.",
        "With any codebase that you work on, it is difficult to debug an error by remembering all the functionality of different classes or how they interacted with each other. Proper utilisation of exception handling procedures can save you a lot of debugging time by including more information when an error is seen.",
        "The above error trace tells you a ",
        " occurred due to so and so reason, as well as the exact location of code where it happened. You cannot be sure, without taking a look at the code, as to what the methods were doing. Then, you need to come up with a hypothesis, do some checks and figure out the exact reason.",
        "What if the error screen was something like this?",
        "The exact context in which the error occurred (when reading a file), cause of the error (cannot deserialize a String) and possible solution (validating the file format) is already there for you. Though, a level of detail like this may not be possible for all scenarios, logging the parameter values and other additional information will help developers debug your application much faster and with less effort.",
        "By going the extra mile of adding some additional information when developing the project you are doing a favor to yourself and to anyone else maintaining the project.",
        "Let’s get to know the files we have in the project that we fetched during the Setup task. The logic is implemented to authenticate users. This is done by checking the username and password they entered against a data source. Application has functionality to perform authentication both when the user is offline (using ",
        " which gets username and password data from a local file) and online (using ",
        " which fetches this information from a site on the cloud)",

        " method checks if the passwords match and returns a message to the user accordingly",
        "The ",
        " file contains the username-password mapping which the ",
        " class utilizes. Check it, does username, ",
        " map to password, ",
        "? Try compiling and running the ",
        " file.",
        "We see an error!",
        "Let’s understand the error printed out. It’s trying to tell us there are a couple of exceptions, ",
        " and ",
        ", which are not caught. We must either ",
        " them or declare the methods to ",
        " these exceptions. The lines causing the error are in the ",
        " file. This file also gets compiled when compiling ",
        " as it’s used within it.",
        "You’ll see VS code underlining the exact lines where the compilation error occurs, in red. Hover over these and you’ll find that the class/method declaration has an extra ",
        " keyword followed by one of the exceptions we saw earlier. To resolve the compilation error, you’d remember from the error seen earlier that the options were",
        "Catch the error OR",
        "Declare exceptions to be thrown.",
        "As you’d have guessed, ",
        " keyword is used to say that a class/method can throw an exception. This leaves the responsibility of dealing with the exception (",
        " ) to the method that uses the ",
        " class. Here, the ",
        " method has to deal with it.",
        "So, the ",
        " method has two options.",
        "Throw the exception using ",
        " so that the exception needs to be handled by any other function calls ",
        "Catch the exception and handle it.",
        "Let’s explore both the methods one by one.",
        " Modify ",
        " to handle the exceptions by throwing both the exceptions. Compile the ",
        " file again. Does it show errors at lines in  ",
        " like before or in a different method?",
        "Similarly, you’ll see the same issue for the ",
        " method as it’s using the  ",
        " method.",
        " Modify ",
        " to throw the exceptions it needs to handle like we did with ",
        ".",
        "With the exceptions declared to be thrown in both the methods, you’ll see that the red lines vanished. What will happen on compiling the ",
        " class now? Think, then act.",
        "Compiler is now complaining about not catching or declaring the exceptions in the ",
        " file. The error is due to using the ",
        " method of the ",
        " class which we declared to throw exceptions in the previous section. With what we have learnt till now, regarding exception handling, we can use the ",
        " to handle exceptions. Ensure ",
        " compiles by throwing the exception like we did for the other two methods before. Run it.",
        "The ",
        " method is user-facing (which we’re simulating using the ",
        " method for now), meaning that the user gets a message \"Login Successful\" in this case.\nThat’s good, we have handled the Exception successfully. Or, have we?",
        "What would the user see if ",
        " causes an exception? (Remember we declared it to throw exceptions).",
        "This is exactly what we had discussed in Milestone 1. It is not helpful for the users to see this.",
        "If you recall, the compiler had given you two options to deal with the exceptions earlier. We’ve seen the \"throws\" option. Now, let's explore the second option which is \"catch\". Catching an exception is where we define beforehand how we want to recover when an exception occurs. Java provides the ",
        " statement for that. The part of the code that can cause an exception is wrapped within the ",
        " clause and how we want to recover from an exception is wrapped within the ",
        " clause.",
        "(Remove any  ",
        " keyword usage in ",
        " so we can explore this ",
        " option)",
        " Use the ",
        " statement to catch ",
        " inside the ",
        " method (",
        " is the parent class of ",
        ". So, catching ",
        " won’t be required after catching ",
        ")",
        "What does the user see when there’s an error now? Compile and execute to find out. Isn’t it a much better message for the user?",
        "For the developers to have debugging information whenever the exception occurs, we can use the ",
        " method of the exception object and configure it to be logged to a log file. This will provide information about where exactly the exception occurred.",
        " Use the debugger to check the flow of the program",
        "In the normal case",
        "When there’s an exception",
        "Set breakpoints on these lines for that",

        "Don’t forget to reset the file name to the correct one, in the LocalStorage class",
        "We looked at how to handle exceptions in the previous milestone.",
        "However, there are scenarios like the server running out of memory or the case of stack overflow which the application shouldn’t try to catch, since these are concerned with the system itself rather than being an issue with the application. Unfavourable situations like the are ",

        " class is again the parent class for other exceptions like the ",
        ". This was why the compiler didn’t throw an \"unreported exception\" error even if we only caught the ",
        " class inside the ",

        "s in Java fall into two categories - Checked and Unchecked. Checked exceptions must either be declared to be thrown or caught. These are \"checked\" by the compiler and it throws an error if we fail to do that. This is what happened when we ran the ",
        " class earlier. We didn’t get to run the class but failed at the compilation stage itself.",
        " Try creating a new method in the ",
        " class which uses the ",
        " method and see if it compiles.",
        "Note: Comment out the new method you just created or ensure you catch the Exceptions inside it",
        "Unchecked exceptions aren’t checked by the compiler. For instance, ",
        " is a common exception caused when we try to call some methods on an object with ",
        " value. These usually signify programming errors and hence is a good practice not to catch them.",

Adonis has a very easy way to create new models, migrations. By default,the boilerplate has two models and database script for your reference.",

        "Below is the example you can refer to:",

        "Here, we will learn what is the role of a controller in a MVC design pattern & how we handle incoming HTTP requests or send responses back via a controller. Here you will handle the routing also.",
        "So the project controller should have functions to handle all these requests and should be routed through created endpoints.",

        "In this module, we will see some detailing about authentication and how we can do authentication by using the ",
        " middleware.",
        "Middlewares are something that hooks into the request lifecycle. There are a set of functions to be executed in sequence to transform the request/response. A middleware can be named, global or server. Check out the references to know more about middlewares.",
        "Here we will use ",
        " as middleware which will serve the authentication purpose. 'auth' uses different authentication schemes such as basic, jwt, session etc. You can use 'jwt' as the authenticator scheme.",
        "Add the middleware in your routing file so that request goes through ",
        " first.",
        "Whenever there is a request at the user registration endpoint, it should send back a jwt token in the response which will be used for further authentication purposes. This token should be used in sending further requests for that user. You can include the jwt token in the request header.",
        "Add support in controllers so that a controller keeps check of authentication. For instance, a user should not be able to fetch other users' projects. As a practice you can first fetch the user of the requested project and check whether the corresponding jwt token matches with the header jwt token or not. This is a standard practice of doing authentications.",
        "Add logic to your controller for 403 forbidden access and 404 resource not found responses. Handling these types of exceptions would make the simple ToDo backend a robust one. Also, think of other possible exceptions and add support for that. You can create exception handler separately by,",
        "Once auth is added after requesting at 'auth/register' endpoint the response data should include jwt token. Head on to ",
        " to decode the jwt token and you should find the user id in the decoded message.\n",
        "As we discussed, an important feature of our backend is whenever we delete a project all the related tasks should also be deleted. That's why we need transactions.",
        "Once the transactions are written, you shouldn't find the tasks associated with a deleted project in the database.\n",
        "Now we shall start the intensive testing of the API you have built using Postman. API testing involves testing the application programming interfaces (APIs) directly and as part of integration testing to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security. In API Testing, instead of using standard user inputs (i.e. using some kind of GUI) and outputs, you use software to send calls to the API, get output, and note down the system's response.",
        "In this module you will test all the APIs you have developed so far. This is a mandatory step before proceeding towards the front end part. Make sure all your endpoints are working as per expectation. Check out the responses you are receiving are correct or not.",
        "First create a user by sending a request to the endpoint",
        "where {{url}} is an environment variable you should save in postman. Check out the environment tab on your upper left side. {{url}} is the base url by default ",
        ". It should be the same as what is in your .env file.",
        "As a response, you should get back the jwt token and then onwards use this ",
        " token in the header (Authentication) to send a request to other endpoints. For instance, log in with the registered user by using the jwt token you got. say, you want to send a project PUT request for this user then, add this jwt token in the header (Authentication) to pass the auth middleware.",
        "Try accessing other users projects. For example, the project with id 5 belongs to user-2. While sending GET to request to {{url}}/projects/5 send the jwt token of user-1 in the header. Check what you are getting as a response. You should get 403 forbidden access (obvious but you need to implement this logic from the preceding task)",
        "Due to the backend being so extensive, the frontend has been left to your own vivid implementations. So do not stop here and try to build a simple frontend for this app to complete your ToDo app.",
        "Below are few of the Postman testing outcomes which are expected.",
        "Here is the demo on how the backend (of a ToDo app) is working. This is tested again with the help of Postman."

        "A well known online shopping site like Flipkart or Amazon has many products (or micro-services) that work behind the scenes. Some of these are user session management, inventory management, logistics, vendor management, search etc. These come together to take orders, orchestrate and finally deliver the order to the customer.",
        "Developers of each of these products maintain many configuration parameters like shopping_cart_timeout_value, default_payment_mode,  etc. at product level.",
        "When these products come up, or after they are up, they will read configuration parameters and use that to tune the way they function. Configuration files provide a quick way to store configuration data.",
        "The Config Manager currently supports configuration in the form of a JSON file. Each product has its own file(s) to store configuration. The Config Manager reads configuration of a product from its JSON configuration file and provides this information to the product. It also writes back to the file when the product wants to make configuration changes/updates.",
        "Sample JSON file",
        "Fetch the code from this ",
        " as specified in the Setup & Getting Started task if you haven’t already.",
        "Let’s look at how our current implementation is laid out & what the different project files are. All project files are under the ",
        " directory. We have version 1 inside the ",
        " directory. Files we have are:",
        " - has utility methods for reading & writing data to the config file in JSON format. Multiple teams will use the methods offered by this Config Manager.",
        " - contains methods required to read/write configuration related to the MySQL database of the inventory team, to JSON files.",
        " - contains methods required to read/write configuration related to the MySQL database & REST server used by the logistics team, to JSON files.",
        " - contains methods required to read/write configuration related to the MySQL database & ",
        " configuration for DNS resolver of the vendor management team, to JSON files.",
        " - calls the respective methods of products to demonstrate the writing and reading of their configuration files.",
        "config_files/ - this directory will be the location where all the configuration files are stored. It may initially not be present and will be created and populated with files when you run the application.",
        " - contains classes like ",
        ", ",
        " to denote the Java objects each configuration creates.",
        "Let’s go a bit deeper to understand what’s happening.",
        " contains ",
        " class which implements two methods ",
        " & ",
        " for interacting with the config files. The files will be stored inside the ",
        " directory. Currently, we’re going with the JSON format to store our configurations as it is pretty common & easy to deal with.",
        "We have many product teams that have to deal with multiple types of configuration. All of them have similar implementations that utilize the ",
        " class methods, for reading/storing specific configuration from/to disk as JSON. For example, the Inventory team’s config handler is ",
        "If we see, the ",
        " method stores the MySQL configuration in a file named ",
        ". Can you quickly check the methods that the Logistics & the Vendor Management teams have?",
        "To demonstrate our implementation, we’ll use the ",
        " file. It calls the methods used by all our teams. In the real product, the same methods may be invoked from a different place. Let’s see how the inventory team’s configurations are called using the methods in ",
        "As you can see, the configuration is first added as fields of a ",
        " object and then passed to the ",
        " method we saw earlier to work its magic!",
        "The ",
        " file has code to interact with other methods as well. Try running the file by right-clicking inside the file and selecting ",
        ". You will see the ",
        " created & the configuration files of all of our teams populated inside it.",
        "Some teams want to move towards XML file based configuration instead of JSON, since XML supports a good set of tools to build, encode, validate and build schemas.",
        "Sample XML file",
        "Not exactly easy for us to read, right? Though XML compromises on human-readability it comes with its advantages as we saw earlier.",
        "One way to implement XML support is to add new methods to read & write XML configuration files inside our ",
        " class. Teams can then utilize these methods.",
        "This version can be found inside the ",
        " directory",
        "If we look inside ",
        ", there are two new methods",
        "The earlier implementation for dealing with JSON configuration is now renamed to ",
        " from ",
        ". Similarly, for the write method as well.",
        "The Logistics team has shifted to XML based configuration, while the Inventory and Vendor teams stay with JSON.",
        "Let’s also check how the implementation of the Logistics team changed in ",
        ".",
        "Ok, they had to change their original implementation by modifying the method names and parameters at multiple places.",
        "Try running the ",
        " file by right-clicking inside the file and selecting ",
        "Compare the contents of ",
        " file, that was just created with the ",
        " file from our earlier implementation. Same configuration, different format, right?",
        "The above design works but has some disadvantages.",
        "Adding support for another file type will involve creating even more methods in ",
        ", making it cluttered. For now, we have renamed previous methods and added two new methods.",
        "The Clients using this code need to make corresponding changes to method names and parameter values, which might be getting invoked in multiple places.",
        "With the implementation in the previous milestone, we see that new methods were put into the ",
        " class. This keeps the implementation in one place. However, with more and more methods being added, the ConfigManager is catering to multiple use cases which are better off in their own class. Having their own class will make it easier to maintain and have clear responsibilities.",
        "Also, the users explicitly need to use method names based on the file type and are no longer generic. If they are making this call in multiple places, users would need to replace all occurrences, to change the file type.",
        "Abstraction addresses these shortcomings by clearly defining a common method signature. Separate classes can implement the same method but internally read the file type of choice. From a user perspective, the methods don’t change based on file type and it is easy to change from one type to another with minimal changes.",
        "Let’s go through an Abstraction driven design for this requirement to understand how it is better.",
        "We had a couple of shortcomings:",
        " class is catering to multiple use cases",
        "Method names in ",
        " are to be changed in all places they’re used.",
        "This redesigned version can be found inside the ",
        " directory.",
        "To combat the first issue, we go with an interface",
        " inside ",
        ". Interface? Yeah, we won’t provide any implementation in this class, just the method names. Other classes will then implement these methods based on the file types they need to support.",
        "Let’s look at what the method definitions are trying to say",
        " - sets an abstract method ",
        " which takes two parameters, ",
        " denoting the configuration file name. ",
        " denotes the configuration type’s class. For MySql, this will be the ",
        " class",
        " - defines the abstract method ",
        " which takes two parameters, configuration file name & the configuration data to be written to the config file.",
        "Now we have the method signature required for reading & writing configuration laid out clearly. Each configuration file type can be supported by a class that implements the interface provided by ",
        ". This class will implement the specific read/write functionality for that type.",
        "You can see that we have a class each for dealing with the JSON & XML configurations. Let’s check the  ",
        " file.",
        "Some points we can understand from the code",
        "The ",
        " class is a subclass of the ",
        " interface",
        "It implements both of the abstract methods defined in ",
        "Similarly, we have the implementation for the XML type configuration in ",
        "All done, right? Hmm, Not really!",
        "Our earlier implementation had one more drawback - we were dealing with the issue of having to change method names and parameter values in all previous implementations, whenever support for a new config file type was added. This made the code harder to maintain.",
        "How did we deal with this in our new implementation based on Abstraction?",
        "Taking a look at the Logistics team’s implementation in ",
        "As the Logistics team moved to using XML, they are creating an object of the ",
        " class and using its methods to read and write configuration XML.",
        "What would the Logistics team need to do if they were having second thoughts to go back to JSON? They’d just need to change ",
        " to an object of type ",
        " instead of  ",
        ". Done!",
        "Right-click inside ",
        " and select ",
        " to run the file.",
        "New requirements have come in. We need to add support for storing configuration in CSV files and also in a Database.",
        "How easy or difficult is it (with the abstraction based design) to add this support?",
        "Practical scenarios",
        "The Java Virtual Machine is an abstraction. Your code can use the exact same java methods irrespective of whether your code will run on Linux or Windows or any other OS. Underneath, a lot of things will change depending on the OS, which the user doesn’t need to know.",
        "You can use a simple API call to fetch weather data or stock prices. These API abstract out the internal complexities of how it is implemented.",
        "Software libraries are good examples of abstraction. They tell you the methods you can use without telling you how they are implemented.",
        "Summary of Abstraction",
        "It separates the method signature from its implementation.",
        "Closely related classes can separate out common fields/methods into a different class and reuse that class.",
        " is it useful? - To the implementers of the class, it is useful since it provides them with the flexibility to change things as long as the method signatures don’t change. For the users, it keeps them from getting exposed to anything other than the method signatures they need to know, reducing complexity.",
        " to apply? - Use a smaller set of public methods",
        "What is the drawback if we don’t use abstraction? - Low maintainability because responsibilities are not clearly differentiated. Higher Complexity with larger code bases because many objects interact with others and it becomes difficult to add functionality without impacting others.",
        "Language specific notes",
        "In Java, ",
        " classes provides total abstraction and ",
        " classes provide partial abstraction",
        "In C++, you can use either header files to achieve abstraction or private methods to hide implementation details.",
        "Python interface can be applied using the the Abstract Base Class library",
        "General Abstraction notes",
        "Hides underlying complexity of data from users",
        "Helps avoid repetitive code",
        "Presents only the signature of internal functionality",
        "Gives flexibility to programmers to change the implementation of the abstract behaviour",
        "Difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction",
        "Abstraction is a natural extension of Encapsulation. Encapsulation recommends that you create entities/objects which contain closely related fields and functionality/methods. Abstraction further recommends that the entities expose only their method signatures to external users who shouldn’t need to worry about the underlying implementation.",
        "Encapsulation - hide data. Abstraction - hide complexity.",
        "What is the difference between a regular class, an abstract class and an interface class in Java?",

        "Relational (or SQL based) databases were popular due to the reduced data duplication they brought with them. However, the reduction in storage costs and massive amounts of unstructured data have paved the way for NoSQL based databases. In a lot of cases where it is not required to deal with complex relational data models that occur due to the large number of tables and the relationships between them, NoSQL comes into play. While the relational databases store data in the form of rows and columns, the NoSQL databases store data as documents (e.g. JSON).",

While the relational databases store data in the form of rows and columns, the NoSQL databases store data as documents (e.g. JSON).",
        "MongoDB is one of the more popular NoSQL databases in use today.",
        "Understand the need for MongoDB",
        "Learn Mongo shell commands",
        "To start the ",
        ", execute ",
        " in the terminal. You’ll see an output similar to the below snapshot.",
        "Note: All Mongo commands covered in this Byte are to be executed while inside the Mongo shell (unless specified otherwise).",
        "It is schema-free and does away with the need to define a fixed structure. You can just start adding data and it isn’t necessary to have any relation between those. The only restriction with this is the supported data structures.",
        "The document format used in place of rows and columns can be easily mapped by programming languages",
        "Horizontally scalable i.e, data can be distributed across multiple servers to improve performance whereas for relational databases, performance can only be improved by increasing the performance of the server it’s run on.",
        "Provides good support for Hierarchical data like JSON or XML. For large amounts of unstructured data, SQL based DB would be significantly slower.",
        "Offers higher efficiency and reliability which in turn helps with better storage capacity and speed requirements.",
        "Let’s look at some of these in more detail",
        "Let’s take an example of some data to be stored in a database. See the data below, for the weather forecast for London city on January 30, 2017 (given by the \"dt\" ",
        ").",
        "Come up with the different tables that would be required to store this data in a relational (SQL) database.",
        "These tables will be required - Coordinates, Weather, Main, Wind, Clouds, Sys and one parent table which has foreign key relationship to all these other tables.",
        "So, we need to come up with the tables to be used, set data types for all the attributes, define the relationships, and create all these tables before going ahead and adding data to these tables. This is termed as having a \"fixed schema\" as the structure is defined before adding data.",
        "MongoDB uses dynamic schema and inherently supports hierarchical data (nested data) as it’s a NoSQL database. This means that the schema (structure) is dynamically created from the data and individual data entries don't have to be in the same format. Hence, there’s no overhead to adding complex data like we saw above, making it a preferred choice to store this kind of data.",
        "As MongoDB can be scaled horizontally, MongoDB clusters can be geographically distributed on servers to improve query performance.",
        "MongoDB is a persistent (or disk-based) database unlike Redis, which is a NoSQL based in-memory database. Though Redis can be significantly faster than MongoDB when the stored data is smaller in size, MongoDB can operate much faster as the database gets larger.",
        "Sharding is the concept of storing partitions of data (shard) in different database servers.",
        "For sharding in relational databases like MySQL, application level changes are required as well as needing to suffer downtime due to interlinking of the tables. These also require servers with high specifications which are costly.",
        "Due to the horizontal scalability, sharding in MongoDB is cost-effective as buying several low-cost machines is often cheaper than buying a smaller number of machines with significantly higher specifications.",
        "Additionally, MongoDB stores data in the BSON (Binary JSON) format.",
        "BSON basically is an improvised version of the popular JSON format used",
        "BSON supports additional data types like Date out of the box in addition to the data types like String, Boolean, Number, Array supported by JSON.",
        "Parsing data is much quicker with BSON as data isn’t saved in text form (human-readable) as in JSON. BSON adds metadata to like lengths of string used to make queries faster",
        "As popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python has data types (",
        ", ",
        ") to which JSON can be directly mapped, it removes any transformation required to process the data.",
        "However, in the below cases, Relational databases are a better bet than NoSQL databases",
        "If large amount of structured data is to be written and it’s critical to avoid loss of data",
        "If the structure of data may not change, \"fixed schema\" of relational databases can be better even with the overhead of designing the schema as it becomes possible to perform complex queries using SQL",
        "If storage is an issue and need to avoid data redundancy",
        "We’ll be using a practical scenario of storing and processing data for QTravels, which is a Hotel Booking portal. As you can imagine, for a large travel website, there will be innumerable subsystems that work in unison to give the end user a great experience. We’ll look at the Reservations component of the website.",

        "The ",
        " command selects a database with the specified name even if it doesn’t exist. Mongo doesn’t create a new database here.",
        "Similar to a relational database (eg: MySql) being made up of a number of Tables, MongoDB database is made up of a number of ",

        "Who is calling greeting() function? Search for it throughout the codebase. Are you able to find the caller? If you are not able to find the function, who calls it?",
        "You may sometimes see this error when you run ./gradle bootRun command",
        "It means that a different instance of your server is running. You may have to kill it before restarting it using lsof -i :8081 and kill commands.",

        "Restart the server and see if you are able to do curl http://localhost:8081/greeting? Answer the question below.",
        "Revert the function name back to greeting() once you are done with this experiment.",

        "Isn’t your main function supposed to execute this single line SpringApplication.run() and then exit the program? How is that your curl command still able to get replies back if your process terminated after executing this single line?",
        "That’s where Spring’s magic comes into picture - with couple of annotations, Spring is running a a server that keeps listening on a port though your main function completed.",
        "Read a bit about",
        "@SpringBootApplication annotation and what it helps with",
        "What this line does - SpringApplication.run(RestServiceApplication.class, args)",
        "Java annotations",
        "As you can see, GreetingController.greeting(String) is the last stack frame, but you are probably not able to find anything else meaningful and you see some functions/variables containing HTTP. That is precisely the point!",
        "Here is what is happening behind the scenes:",
        "You are sending a HTTP request (http://localhost:8081/greeting) to the web server running on port 8081 either through curl or through your browser - both send the exact same request",
        "Your spring server receives this HTTP request, processes it all the way up the stack, and hands it over to some function which is marked with @GetMapping(\"/greeting\") annotation.",
        "Spring uses the @GetMapping annotation to find which function to call - so if you add one more annotation + function, you would have created one more end point and you call it by curl http://localhost:8081/newendpoint",
        "What are the other annotations you see in the code? Can you guess what they do? If you spend time now to understand what they mean, you will save hours of debugging time later when you work on a larger code base.",
        "@RestController - Tip: Assume your Java code has 1000s of classes. Which classes should your Spring search for to find @GetMapping?",
        "@RequestParam",
        "How did we tell the server to listen on 8081 when the ",
        " you referred to used 8080? Tip: grep for the \"8081\" across all files.",
        "How do you create an endpoint for a POST request? Look for annotations to do that in Spring.",
        "If you had a keen eye, you would have seen greeting() function returning a Java object.",
        "But the caller of this function, which is your curl command or your browser through indirect hops will not be able to understand Java objects. In fact they received a JSON response.",
        "How did this happen? Did you ever remember converting the Greeting java object to a JSON string?",
        "Jackson is a java library that helps you convert a Java object into JSON and back. Whenever required Spring automagically uses Jackson library to convert Java objects into JSON and back. It uses a class in Jackson library called ObjectMapper to do this. Now how do you see for yourself that this is happening? Again breakpoints are our friends.",
        "Set a breakpoint at setName() function in CreditCard.java and run the server in debug mode.",
        "Issue the curl command to the json-request endpoint.",
        "You will be hitting the breakpoint and look at the stack trace. Are you able to see ObjectMapper.readValue()?",
        "If you walk down the stack trace further, it will be obvious that Spring called it when trying to process the request.",
        "You noticed the setter being called when deserializing the JSON string into a Java object. What do you think will get called when serialization happens? Can you prove that by setting an appropriate breakpoint in Greeting class?",
        "How did Jackson know which variable to store creditCardNumber in from the JSON string? Try playing around with the input JSON and variable names in the CreditCard.java class and see if you can make out the relationship.",
        "Add @JsonIgnore on top of id field in Greeting.java",
        "See what output you get for your curl command. Try to read/reason out about the output.",
        "Can you now write a simple HTTP end-point using Spring Boot? Btw, no one writes these from scratch including the build.gradle - pick the tutorial code and keep adding more endpoints!",

        "A sample project layout is shown below (for ",
        " projects).",
        "Containerizing your app involves encapsulating or packaging up the code and all its dependencies so that it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. It allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely. With traditional methods, code is developed in a specific computing environment which, when transferred to a new location, often results in bugs and errors.",
        "Containerized applications are “isolated”; in the sense that they do not bundle in a copy of the operating system. Instead, an open source runtime engine (such as the Docker runtime engine) is installed on the host’s operating system and becomes the conduit for containers to share an operating system with other containers on the same computing system.",

        " here.",
        "Can you access the terminal inside a container? Check this ",
        " for how to go about doing that. Keep in mind that to run a shell inside your container, your image should have a shell installed in the first place (add commands to your Dockerfile for adding a shell or use an image that already has one installed, like ubuntu).",

        "GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.\nThese actions form the steps to a workflow. A workflow can be imagined as a fixed set of instructions (actions) that are run at some particular event occurrence. Github workflows play an important part when it comes to developing apps.\nTwo use cases for using workflows:",
        "This way, you can focus more on your application logic and less on building and deployment. Building applications on the cloud becomes a little easier with help of Github Actions.

        "There are multiple options for the choice of environment to deploy Kuberenetes on. You can choose one of the many cloud providers to host your cluster on their systems. You can also choose to host a single node (machine) cluster on your own machine.",
        "The pros for choosing an online platform:",
        "The cons:",
        "You should have a Kubernetes cluster set up and functioning. You can verify this situation by running the following command which checks for all resources deployed to the cluster in the ",
        " namespace.",
        "You can try the following command, with an example output shown:",
        "You have learnt about containers, understood why they are important and even built one for your app, so far. The containers ran on your local machine and utilised your system's resources. It is a good method for testing out your app and your Dockerfile but not an ideal way to deploy real applications. Some of the reasons for that are:",
        ": To make your app accessible to the outside world (your customers), you'll have to connect your container to a port that has external access. It requires knowledge of networking and a good amount of planning to execute, especially when you have multiple containers running different applications and have varied needs for communication. It would be better to have a service that standardizes exposing your apps to the public, while handling common tasks like ",
        ".",
        ": The application you're building should be accessible at all times, which means your computer must be running 24x7 to ensure a good service, but it is\nimpractical to keep your machine running throughout the day, every day.",
        ": What happens if our app becomes popular and we see a surge in client traffic?\nThe response times would be affected, and we would want to have a more powerful\nmachine or maybe multiple machines altogether depending on the situation.\nAgain, this is not possible, going by the current implementation.",
        "Going by the arguments above, you need an \"orchestration platform\" that can manage your containers across different machines (nodes), handle discovery of the different services (apps), configure the bulk of networking for you and allow you to observe and monitor for errors. These are some of the functions among the host of others that orchestration platforms support. One such, and the most popular among them, is Kubernetes.",
        "With this context, watch the following video to get a clearer picture of why Kubernetes comes into the picture and what it can do for you. Also, check out this ",
        " to gain an insight into what Kubernetes is and what it is not, as well as the following video -",

        " section that you can check out if you're unclear about the technology. Feel free to search for more resources and learn from multiple sites to get a hold on this notoriously complex subject.",
        "In the 'Requirements' section below, we'll be covering step by step, some important components of Kubernetes. The knowledge of them will help you explore more on your own and will keep from you getting intimidated by the jargon when you go ahead with building more complex applications on Kubernetes.",
        "Hopefully, by now you understand that Kubernetes makes deploying apps easy on distributed systems. There is a master and one or more workers. The master has a lot of components that allow Kubernetes to function. Among them is the ",

        "You'll learn about the specification for the different Kubernetes objects, write one for your app and see your app running on the cluster.",
        "Up to this point, all you needed to run applications in containers was a Dockerfile and an image that you built on top of it. To run an app on Kubernetes, you need to define a configuration file for every object you wish to deploy. How is this file written and what information does it convey? Read the page ",
        " to learn extensively about writing specifications in YAML.",
        "You are familiar with running containers but the smallest units that can be deployed in Kubernetes are pods. Nothing to fret about, pods are just a group of closely related containers that share the same network (localhost). Learn more about Pods ",

You have seen how you can take an application, containerize it using a Dockerfile, build an image for it, push it to a registry and then use the image for a container you run inside a Kubernetes cluster.

        "Build an e-commerce app from scratch using Flutter and secure the app with proper authentication using Firestore as the database.",
        "I recommend installing VSCode along with the Flutter and Dart plugins to start developing flutter-based apps.",
        "If you're using the Flutter framework for the first time, I'd suggest you to go online and get a basic idea of what Flutter is and how it works. It'll help you connect better with the work that you're going to be doing.",
        "We will set up the basic skeleton of the app first. If you are making a Flutter app for the first time, refer this ",
        ". After successfully setting up your new flutter project, we will now make two directories:",
        "The file structure for the completed app would be similar to the image below.",
        "We're also going to need a few flutter packages available at ",
        ". For which we need to add few dependencies in ",
        " file, which should then look like -",
        "After setting up the project, we'll set up the firestore project and make the skeleton database structure:",
        "If you're using firebase for the first time, I'd recommend you to check this ",
        " out.",
        "Make a clean structure of how your database should look like. Decide what all collections should be incorporated and then further decide the structure and fields of the documents in each collection. You should atleast have these discrete collections -",
        "we'll discuss more on how the documents in each collection should look like in the later sections.",
        "Once you've made the skeleton of the database, it's time to connect your database with the application. Check this ",
        " out for a detailed walk-through.",
        "Search for different basic flutter packages and start using them for your own testing purpose.",
        "An important thing to note while making the screens and using the variables that power your app, is state management.",
        "There are different options you can take to manage state in your application. I'll list a few of them below:",
        "The BLoC principle can be used to provide fast, reactive state management. The changes in variables are reflected almost instantly. Check widgets like stream builders etc.",
        "To handle asynchronous data, I'd recommend using widgets like futures and future builders. It however, requires some initial set-up and boilerplate code to get it running. Research articles on how to build reactive apps on Flutter and this might help you get started on it.",
        "You can transfer variables between different screens using their constructors. It is the easiest way to achieve state management.",
        "It however gets a bit complex with increasing state variables and might lead to complications, further into development.",
        " about good design practices. Learn how you can make your app more accessible and user friendly.",
        "Evaluate your choice of widgets to use; fancier ones are appealing but keep utility in mind while making the choice. Check ",
        " for some cool widgets.",
        "Start with making the Homescreen, which should look like the image below. Use ",
        " for many designing and development resources. That navigation bar can be made using the curved navigation bar package available at pub.dev. Location icon shows the current location of the device, check this ",
        " out for a detailed walk through. I recommend placing all the location service related code in a separate dart file in the functionalities directory.The horizontal scrollable list under \"Top stores nearby\" shows all the stores nearby. We'll later discuss how to query stores based on the current location.",
        "Build the discover page. It's a very basic page with a tab-bar in it, the categories which will show products of that particular category, and the Shops tab which will show the products of that particular shop. Showing products of a particular shop or catagory or both can be tackled with simple firestore queries.",
        "Build the Orders page, which again is a simple task. All you need to do is query the orders collection based on the user data, then display using a list view.",
        "Making a wishlist page. I'd recommend storing the wishlist data of a particular user in a separate field of the user document. Which can simply be a list of the product ids of all the products in the wishlist. Now you just have to show those products with simple querying in a way similar to the image below.",
        "Making the product listview page, which basically shows different query results of the products collection, like search query, shop specific query, section specific query, discount specific query etc.",
        "Product description page. Whenever we tap on a product from the query result, we are navigated to another page which displays the complete product description. Descriptions include the full size images, price, discount, sizes, variants etc. This also contains shop details which is offering that specific product.",
        "To build the cart page, I'd recommend the same to have a separate field in the user document (in users collection). This will have all the cart related information, like product ids of the products in the cart and  their quantities. The cart should look like the image below. The card layout can be achieved using the card widget and the stack widget (which gives that effect to the delete button on the top right).",
        "On tapping the place order in the cart, you should be navigated to the review cart page. This will give you a summary of your order, address details, payment details etc. Again basic querying from the firestore should do most of the work. Adding a new address or edit phone number will require you to update the user document.",
        "To implement features like \"Place Order\", basic CRUD functions can be used. Store the order data in the orders collection. Make sure to include fields like payment detailed, address, userId etc.",
        "When you open the application for the first time or after logging out you're taken to a login page. If you're a new user, you can choose to register. Further, complete its form validation and authentication error handling by enabling registration of users using email or Gmail through Firebase authentication. The login/register pages should look like these:",
        "After registration/login page, users should be redirected to the homepage. In case of error in any of the credentials, the appropriate error must be displayed.",
        "The following figure is what your user's document in firestore should look like (with respect to the parameters assigned to each user like name, address, wishlist, cart etc).",
        "At this point, the login/register pages must be made along with its error handling. Also the user must be redirected to the home screen page upon successful login. Check for all sorts of errors (email, password, password confirmation error) in the forms and give appropriate errors for each. Your cloud function should be able to make the skeleton document of the user upon registration.",
        "Try making different permutations of errors possible to test your app’s functionality.",
        "By now, you should be comfortable with handling location services. I'd recommend you to store this location data in a widget called ",
        ", which is similar to shared preferences but with subscription to the data. I'd also recommend you to use some provider widgets to make this variable available down the widget tree, this will come in handy while accessing location data in different pages.",
        "Make sure your documents in the shop collection have a field for storing the location data of the shop. The data structure that we'll be using here is a map, with two keys:",
        "Fully explore the GeoFlutterFire package and experiment with different radius for queries.",
        "Implement small features like locking the place order button if some of the products in the cart are not available nearby.",
        "We're just using the current user location for querying, see if you can change the centre of the query by passing a different geo data.",
        "Display the address from the geo data collected.",
        "Now the application will only show nearby stores or products offered by nearby stores. This includes search results, filters, sorts etc.\n",
        "By now you should have a basic application ready without the payment system. Although you can still have an option to complete the order with cash on delivery, it's always better to have an online payment system. Here, we're going to use Paytm APIs because it covers all the major online payment methods like cards, netbanking, UPIs etc.",
        "Since Paytm provides its own web based UI for the payment portal, we don't have to focus much on the UI part. Instead we'll just use a web view to simply aid the payment portal.",
        "We'll be implementing firebase cloud functions and then integrating the payment web API into those firebase functions. Further we'll be using those functions in our flutter application using web view.",
        "You should now have a working online payment system. The complete UI should look something like this:",
        "Payment web view:",
        "Transaction status page:",
        "This part is completely optional, but push notifications does give that fancy touch to the application.",
        "We'll be using Firebase cloud messaging to implement easy push notifications. Find documentation on Firebase cloud messaging ",
        ".",
        "Your application should now be equipped with a strong push-notification system. Users will now receive customized notifications at various different events.",
        "Till now, you have set up your app’s basic form. Now it’s time to amp up the app by adding some interesting features.",
        " This is an optional milestone for those who want to go that extra mile.",
        "Here are some recommendations you can adopt to make your app even better:",
        "A profile page. Here, the user can edit all the personal information like phone number, address.",
        "Automated email and texts. Use of automated emails and texts for verifications and sending useful information.",
        "Products recommendations.",
        "Use of google analytics, for better understanding the user behaviour towards the application. Check this ",
        " for more details.",
        "A proper functioning search bar.",
        "Users should have the option of sharing the product details to other users.",
        "Using advanced flutter animations to further improve the appearance of the application.",
        "Add a feature for collecting user feedbacks.",
        "Every products and shops can be rated by the users.",
        "Customised search results based on user's activity.",
        "Finally when you're all done, publish your app to the google playstore.",
        "Make necessary changes for the iOS devices and then move forward to publish it in the app store as well.",

The user must click consecutive blocks within that time framework. If the user misses the block or clicked (touched) the wrong block then the block the user touches must become red temporarily. Please see the references for a better understanding.\nAfter 60 seconds we have to show the result to the users, i.e. how many the user had missed and how many were clicked correctly.",

While mapping we have to consider the data, type of data and its relations with its self-entity or entity in any other table.",

        "In Spring MVC, a controller class is written to handle requests coming from the client. Then, the controller invokes a business class to process business-related tasks, and then redirects the client to a logical view name, which is resolved by Spring's dispatcher servlet in order to render results or output. Spring Controller annotation is typically used in combination with annotated handler methods based on the RequestMapping annotation.",

        "DAO stands for Data Access Object. It’s a design pattern in which a data access object (DAO) is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanisms. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, DAOs provide some specific data operations without exposing details of the database. While developing a web application, one of the most important aspects is to deal with the database like connection management and transaction management.",

Apache Tomcat server will manage to do it. It’s an open-source program that processes HTTP requests to access the files stored within a server. These files can be static (it means that whenever a client asks for it they will be shared as they are) or dynamic (before sending files to the client they are generated by the software hosted on a server). In short, Tomcat handles communication via HTTP protocol and delegates requests to the Spring MVC application.",

It is the most important step in any application as it keeps the app secure by ensuring the users are verified.\nIn this project, we will first implement the most basic form of authentication i.e. user-id and password based authentication.

        "Think this over - If HTTP is a stateless protocol (i.e. every request to the server is independent of the previous request and server doesn't know anything about client) then how will the server know that the client is requesting for something is valid (i.e. authenticity of the user and the request)?",
        "Example - Let's say we are using Gmail. To access our emails via our Gmail account we need to give our credentials (email-id & password) to get past the security steps. Here what happens is that a request is sent to the server and since the request contains the credentials (in some form), the server can verify the authenticity of our request, and give us access to our Gmail accounts. But let's suppose we again type 'gmail.com' in the browser after sometime i.e. we are again sending a request to the server for our account access, and as before the server doesn't know anything about us. So, logically the server will ask you again for your credentials (i.e. email-id & password) but do we need to re-enter our credentials again? We don't. Server will give us the required access again this time too without us re-entering our credentials.",

In this task you will learn about web app servers, connecting your app to a target server and run the app on localhost to test out the app. Also the concept of API will be briefed here.",
        "You might have noticed, as and when we are adding more and more APIs, managing everything using the 'HTTP' module alone will become complicated. Even adding a single API will require us to look at the entire code and then add the new API at appropriate parts of the code. We will try to simplify that in this module.",
        "We will be building a small part of ",

        "Now that we know a way legitimate users can update their profile i.e. we have implemented one private API. But, one issue here is that every time a user wants to update his profile, he needs to enter their credentials again and again. This is not at all a good user experience (think how will you feel when every time you type ",
        " we have to re-enter your credentials every time). In this module we will try to fix this behaviour.",
        "The idea is that instead of sending ",
        " and ",
        " with each request, we will send ",
        " and ",
        " in the first request. The server then sends us a token which is valid for a particular duration. Now, every time we need to send a request to a private API, we will send the token instead and if the token is valid, the server will know that the user requesting the info is legitimate.",
        "It is a good idea to always send ",
        " in headers. It will help in separating the logical request with the authentication part.",
        "To test whether the ",
        " really expires or not, you can set the expiry to 1 minutes and test the same instead of waiting for it to expire after 1 hr.",
        "Remember, the information encoded with ",
        " is publicly accessible. So, never include sensitive information in your token.",
        "It is recommended to use the 3rd optional argument in ",
        " library instead of manually setting the expiry in the payload.",
        "Though at the end it will add a few arguments in the payload only. It has a few advantages -",
        "After you have successfully implemented the APIs, the app behaviour will look something like below -",
        "We have almost finished our backend APIs. A few things to solve for -",
        "In this module we will primarily fix these 2 issues.",
        "The app should behave like before after you have successfully implemented the APIs -",
        "You might have seen several services which send you an email whenever you login or perform some actions on the application.\nSuppose you want to build similar functionality for your application. As you might have noticed, we might need to send email in a lot of use cases. So, let's build a separate API which just sends an email. Everyone should not be able to access this internal API. That API should be accessed only by us and by our other APIs. How do you prevent other users accessing this API?",
        "In this module you will learn the basic idea of building an API which can only be accessed internally or by us.",

        "you should find the server running on the PORT configured in ",

        "Here, we will see how to create database models, migration scripts which will help communicate with the database and als get introduced to the lucid model. Adonis has a very easy way to create new models, migrations. By default,the boilerplate has two models and database script for your reference.",
        "Below is an example to refer to creating the project migration script.",
        "Below is the example you can refer to:",
        "By default, the id is incremental which means it will start from 1 and will keep incrementing. You can also go for a randomly generated id. Research a bit to know how you can generate random user ids.",
        "If your migration runs are successful, you will see the tables created in the MySQL workbench.\n",
        "Here, we will learn what is the role of a controller in a MVC design pattern & how we handle incoming HTTP requests or send responses back via a controller. Here you will handle the routing also.",
        "So the project controller should have functions to handle all these requests and should be routed through created endpoints.",
        "So write functions to register a user and implement login facilities. Use auth functions like below:",
        "Once your controllers are ready, run the server (in development mode) by",
        "Test with Postman whether routing is happening or not by printing debug messages onto the console. You will have a detailed testing module in the tasks ahead to check whether the backend is working or not.\n",
        "In this module, we will see some detailing about authentication and how we can do authentication by using the ",
        " middleware.",
        "Middlewares are something that hooks into the request lifecycle. There are a set of functions to be executed in sequence to transform the request/response. A middleware can be named, global or server. Check out the references to know more about middlewares.",
        "Here we will use ",
        " as middleware which will serve the authentication purpose. 'auth' uses different authentication schemes such as basic, jwt, session etc. You can use 'jwt' as the authenticator scheme.",
        "Add the middleware in your routing file so that request goes through ",
        " first.",
        "Whenever there is a request at the user registration endpoint, it should send back a jwt token in the response which will be used for further authentication purposes. This token should be used in sending further requests for that user. You can include the jwt token in the request header.",
        "Add support in controllers so that a controller keeps check of authentication. For instance, a user should not be able to fetch other users' projects. As a practice you can first fetch the user of the requested project and check whether the corresponding jwt token matches with the header jwt token or not. This is a standard practice of doing authentications.",
        "Add logic to your controller for 403 forbidden access and 404 resource not found responses. Handling these types of exceptions would make the simple ToDo backend a robust one. Also, think of other possible exceptions and add support for that. You can create exception handler separately by,",
        "Once auth is added after requesting at 'auth/register' endpoint the response data should include jwt token. Head on to ",
        " to decode the jwt token and you should find the user id in the decoded message.\n",
        "As we discussed, an important feature of our backend is whenever we delete a project all the related tasks should also be deleted. That's why we need transactions.",
        "Once the transactions are written, you shouldn't find the tasks associated with a deleted project in the database.\n",
        "Now we shall start the intensive testing of the API you have built using Postman. API testing involves testing the application programming interfaces (APIs) directly and as part of integration testing to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security. In API Testing, instead of using standard user inputs (i.e. using some kind of GUI) and outputs, you use software to send calls to the API, get output, and note down the system's response.",
        "In this module you will test all the APIs you have developed so far. This is a mandatory step before proceeding towards the front end part. Make sure all your endpoints are working as per expectation. Check out the responses you are receiving are correct or not.",
        "First create a user by sending a request to the endpoint",
        "where {{url}} is an environment variable you should save in postman. Check out the environment tab on your upper left side. {{url}} is the base url by default ",
        ". It should be the same as what is in your .env file.",
        "As a response, you should get back the jwt token and then onwards use this ",
        " token in the header (Authentication) to send a request to other endpoints. For instance, log in with the registered user by using the jwt token you got. say, you want to send a project PUT request for this user then, add this jwt token in the header (Authentication) to pass the auth middleware.",
        "Try accessing other users projects. For example, the project with id 5 belongs to user-2. While sending GET to request to {{url}}/projects/5 send the jwt token of user-1 in the header. Check what you are getting as a response. You should get 403 forbidden access (obvious but you need to implement this logic from the preceding task)",
        "Due to the backend being so extensive, the frontend has been left to your own vivid implementations. So do not stop here and try to build a simple frontend for this app to complete your ToDo app.",
        "Below are few of the Postman testing outcomes which are expected.",
        "Here is the demo on how the backend (of a ToDo app) is working. This is tested again with the help of Postman."

        "In our day-to-day life, we come across various examination results such as school exam results, competitive exam results, college semester exam results, etc. How efficiently it produces someone's result by just filling in student details! But, have you ever thought of creating one? The ones who did basically went through the hectic job of perfecting their database and then using the knowledge of front-end and back-end to do so.\n",

        "\n",
        "So, this project is also divided into 3 parts:",
        "We start by settings things up for the front-end, then for database and then move towards to the back-end part.",
        "The main objective of this milestone is to make sure that you understand the basic overflow of the project. Also, you should have a code editor and apache distribution in place. With this you should be able to access the MySQL, phpmyadmin home page and your project files.",
        "Let's start ourselves from the result section!!",
        "What exactly we want from our system? Yes, you are thinking it right. We want from our system that it should take student details as input such as ",
        ", ",
        ", ",
        " (for hiding it from other students, if required) and produce his/her result as output. Make a ",
        " file with some convenient name and make a form which takes ",
        " and ",
        " as input. On submit, it should perform required SQL query(s) to obtain the result as output.\n",
        "\n",
        "But wait! From which table are we going to fetch the required data? Did we create any table in the ",
        " database? Yes, you are right, we don't have any table yet. Go ahead and create a table called ",
        ". But what should be the attributes in the table? The simplest table should have at least these following attributes -",
        "Apart from that you can add attributes if you want such as gender, mail, contact number, etc. But this should be there for proper data storing and fetching. Shouldn't it?",
        "You should be able to make a database, table and attributes with some data into it. You should also be able to get student data as input, parse it, perform search queries and output it to the user.",
        "Let's analyze our previous database from various DBMS perspectives.\n",
        "The answer to all the questions is ",
        ", why? Think about it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's suppose if some student data is changed like address, contact number, etc. Then, we have to reflect that change at all the entries in the database because there are many entries for a single unique student depends on number of subjects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, it is not looking great if we have to scale it for various classes, schools, etc. Because at the end data will become more and more redundant. Also, we can't perform other high level operations on this current database due to its not so good looking structure.",
        "You should be able to justify why this database will not be a good fit in terms of various purposes that are mentioned above. You should be able to understand what normalization is and why there is need to normalize.",
        "Let's split our original table ",
        " into various usable and manageable tables. The tables are split in a manner such that data will remain consistent.",
        "You should be able to make various tables for this database and its corresponding attributes.",
        "Now, as we have our new database structure, we definitely have to rewrite the SQL queries for student result fetching.\n",
        "\n",
        "Start from what your user will type at the front-end. We can safely assume that your user will know at least his/her Roll Id, Class Name and Section. But our user doesn't know that how the class name and section is stored in the database. Also, we as developers don't know that how users will type his/her class name and section because there are many possibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, to make it clear for both the user and you, we should give them a drop-down menu of all the classes in our database. From which table of our database we will do it? Yes, you are right from ",
        " table. User will see his/her class name along with section and in return we will store the class id.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the code for your reference.",
        "Store the roll id and class id in some variables on the redirected page after user click submit.",
        "Now, coming to the query part where we bind our above parameters and fetch student result. Result should at least contains his/her subject name (not subject id because user don't know about subject id at all), corresponding marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the query for the same.",
        "You should be able to fetch and output student result accurately by taking input as per your willingness.",
        "As said earlier this project is divided into 3 parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "We settled up things for the front-end and database, it's time to move towards the back-end part.\n",
        "\n",
        "But is there any need to develop a back-end part separately? Why this is required?\n",
        "\n",
        "Till now we have been doing our back-end part with the database. But this is not looking convenient for adding, deleting and modifying data. That's why there is a need to make a separate back-end portal where we can add/update student details like class, subject, subject combination, result and other details through a proper UI.",
        "The main motive of this milestone is to understand the concept behind making an admin portal. You should be able to design basic outline of the admin portal.",
        "Let's try to build each module (renamed option to module).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, I will explain 2 functionalities - add and update classes. Rest all are similar in nature just the SQL query changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make a form which takes all the input corresponding to each attribute in ",
        " table.",
        "On submitting the form it should perform a MySQL insert query into the ",
        " of same database.",
        "Your back-end code should resemble below code -",
        "Make a table which shows all the classes details such as serial number, class name, class section, etc. depending on your table structure.",
        "Make an extra column for each row for editing that entry in the database, attach the class id with that value.",
        "Print the existing details in form format for that class id to user using MySQL select command which user can change.",
        "After submitting form, the back-end of that page should perform MySQL update query as follows -",
        "You should able to design, code and test each module using your admin portal and ",
        " database server.",
        "Now, the need arises to secure this admin section. Why? Because otherwise students will change theirs and others results and details which in turn becomes a very serious issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two ways to secure this admin section - first is to separate this portal completely with new location and project while the second is to make it password protected. First is not actually a full proof solution. Why? Because if anyone gets to know about this portal and its location then eventually the same problem still persists. So, we will go with the second approach.",
        "Make a new table into database with attributes - ",
        " and ",
        ".",
        "Fill these values depending on the administrative team.",
        "Make a form which accepts user name and password as an input and in turns verifies from this table data.",
        "If the entries filled are correct then store these values in the session for future reference and land him to the actual admin section.",
        "The main motive of this milestone is to make admin section secure. You should be able to authenticate the person before sending him to the admin section.",
        "Now, we are at the end stage of this project. We will try to put all things together and test it. Additionally you will learn how to generate PDF with required content so that one can download and share it wherever he/she wants.",
        "The main motive of this milestone is to make every cluster club together and test it's functionalities."

        "First we set up the environment and ",
        " and do a low level implementation (Proof of Concept) of the components involved in the project. For this we are going to automate the login process to get started.",
        "You may go through ",
        " as well for dependency installation.\nIn this example Firefox has been used as the browser but you are free to use any browser of choice; the only aspect that varies is the change in web driver packages for each browser.",
        "There are some nice to have settings like profiles and options you can go through in ",
        "Example:",
        "Install ",
        " and all other necessary packages",
        "Explore how ",
        " and ",
        " works.",

        "Checkout unique identifiers for the input fields login and passwords.",
        "Explore how ",
        " help locating various elements in a web page.",
        "Examples:",
        "Discover login, password and submit elements and interact with them to achieve sign in. Use driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath) to find the elements and use input_element.send_keys(“text”) to send text in the input boxes. Use submit_element.click() to achieve click action.",
        "The idea of this milestone is that you should explore how a web page is structured and how to inspect various components of a webpage like input fields, text, buttons etc. before interacting with them.\nThen to achieve automated login activity with just a few lines of code.\n",
        "When we open the explore page we need to click on the first post to get started with the crawling. After that we need to click on the like button to like the post and click on the next icon to advance to further posts. At this stage we need to store the URL of the images/videos in a metadata csv along with other attributes like profile name, number of likes, and comments etc, to be able to process it later. Further if we need to comment as well, we can use send_keys function in selenium to simulate typing by a user. Here we can store some hard coded messages in an array in a json file to be loaded at time of running and randomly publishing comments from this array.",
        "Alternatively, we can also use ML to detect sentiment of the post using the post description text/other comments to further improve it. But for basic proof of concept we will stick to either hard coded responses or duplicate other comments. Further we can follow a profile using the following button. After following a page we can also redirect to that page and like other sets of posts on that page as well.",
        "Now, to prevent thrashing and throttling at instagrams servers, we need to limit our requests for that we need to put sleep of random time at various stages of our script. Also, instead of crawling just the explore page generically, we can also crawl particular tags as well.",
        "Open various starter links for explore page/ tags page/ profile page using driver.get, note here while using driver.get function our page might reload and we can lose reference to previously stored elements in variables.",
        "Explore element ",
        " and ",
        " functionality to interact with buttons. This might be needed for two reasons, one selenium can't interact with an element if it's not in the view, and secondly, in modern web pages content loads dynamically, so scrolling down may trigger loading of additional content. We can also achieve scrolling by running javascript functions using python as shown below.",
        "The idea of this milestone is that you should explore how to interact with the webpage and automate various interactions like clicking and typing which can be done using selenium. Also, it will also help to grasp the concept of rate limiting and throttling and how to prevent it.",
        "The automation process should be like this -",
        "In this task we will use ",
        " functionality from ",
        " library to fetch posts from Instagram's server. While the automation is running it can encounter various ",
        " for which we need to handle them using pythons; and this is called exception handling. We also need to log these errors to further develop the script.",
        "The metadata (consisting of pictures, videos, comments mainly) are collected so that they can be subjected to some ML /DL models from which you can further advance this project by gaining analysis reports, like sentiment/emotion analysis, auto-reply and much more.",
        ": This is a completely optional task and as it is just an idea for you to work on. If you are in for a challenge then surely you should try this out. Else you can simply skip this milestone.",

Further, after this, you can take this project in a new direction after this milestone. Completing this milestone is critical as there are a lot of components that need to be integrated together to complete the chatbot; having a clear sense of product architecture is needed here.",
        "Have a look at the High-Level approach which we briefed earlier",

        "You would have seen here also that we were only able to find 2 songs corresponding to the ",
        " tag. So, instead of using the tags returned by the Emotional API, we can map them using the mapping defined earlier above.",
        "Now, once a user would click on a particular song, we also need to recommend similar songs to that particular song. This can also be done using the last.fm's ",
        " API using the track and the artist of the song.",
        "By now, you have a complete system and a good understanding of the project's flow, which is satisfied by the above requirements.",
        "Once you have understood the complete flow, you can do whatever you want now. You can go forward with building a command-line interface that collects all these things and does them. Or you can build a separate Flask/Django server that can do the above steps as a part of an API or a Web Page.",
        "As a part of this milestone, we would be continuing with building a Django/Flask server.",
        "Building the following API's",
        "We can make a template inside your Django/flask app which has a page similar to this:",
        "Here, on the left, I have the songs recommended to the user, and on the right-hand side are the songs which were recommended based on one of the songs which I clicked on.",
        "Further, the emotion of the chat is shown at the top",
        "Context of the Cakechat Chatbot is: at max last 3 conversations.",
        "You can do this milestone in your own style.",
        "Further, you can learn about docker and build a docker-compose file that provides all the services in one place.",
        "By the end of this milestone, you would have a working chatbot system with a good UI that recommends songs to the user along with chatting."

        "If you are taking this Byte on your personal Linux machine, open a new terminal and proceed to the next milestone. You may skip the rest of this milestone.",
        "To open a terminal in the Crio Workspace, follow the steps below:",
        "Click on the workspace icon on the left sidebar and click on the ",
        " button to create your workspace (",

        "Click on ",

        "If you remember, we had created a container ",
        " using Dockerfile. Lets try to run it again.",
        "This will leave the container running. Now, let's open another terminal and check if the container is running. To do that, issue this command in another terminal.",
        "Do you see the output?",
        "Here, we first tried to list all running containers, if your container is not listed here, which means it's not running. Check if it appears in stopped containers.",
        "Which lists all containers including stopped one’s",
        "Is there a way to start this stopped container again?",
        "Note that this container id is the one picked up from ps.",
        "Now, lets confirm tha the container is running",
        "Do you remember, when we initially ran the container, we also mapped ports? Do you remember how we mapped them?",
        "This mapped guest port 80 with host port 80. If I am not wrong, this should still be active. Lets try that out?",
        "So, an important point to note here is, ",
        "So it is very important to decide port binding and volumes upfront, when you run the container for the first time.",
        "Now, let’s try to run the apache container from our host content.",

        "Lets run docker exec command",
        "Nothing happened. Why? Looks like we messup with some parameters. Letscheck the parameters",
        "So, the command we issued was actually executed, but nothing reported back. Because we missed few parameters.,",

        "Lets try it again",
        "You can see the terminal opened for bash process. Lets tryt to play around by using ls, cd cat commands",
        "By the way, in these commands, you would have seen that the content of index.html is exactly the same as what we saw without ",
        " command.",
        "Now let's try to change these contents.",
        "First exit from the terminal inside container.,",
        "Then lets try to create a simple file on our host machine.",
        "Now, let's copy this file into docker container.",
        "Syntax is",
        "Here, ",
        " means remote host. This parameter is available across all docker commands, when you want to execute the, on a remote docker host.",
        "Lets run this command now. We will ignore the ",
        " option as we are running on localhost only. Default docker host is localhost.",
        "Now lets connect to the docker again to see if the contents are changed.",
        "Does it reflect on the apache server on the container which is attached to port 80?",
        "Now, lets stop this container",
        "Do you know what this ",
        " is? Its container name. When you run a container, docker runtime gives it a cool name, if not already provided",
        "So you can use --name parameter while starting the container.",
        "Lets try this option with port 8080 instead of 80.",
        "Before that, lets go to previous bash screen to confirm that the container is stopped.",
        "So we are ready to start the container again.",
        "Lets first create a file on our host system",
        "Confirm that the file is created and contents are there as expected.",
        "Now start the container",
        "Note that we have three changes in the command",

        "-v html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs - We are mounting a local volume on the apache server, so that the we can share the file system.",
        "Lets see the results one by one.",
        "docker ps",
        "Now that we are done with playing around with docker, lts now try to stop the container.",
        "Lets see how many images are there now.",
        "Lets try to remove an image",
        "Will show a bunch of images which are used and unused.",

        "Now, QMoney decided to allow users to make trades with stock exchanges. The stock exchange provided a library that could best run on Python, while QMoney used java as a primary language of development.",
        "This resulted in QMoney hosting another microservice built in python to provide the functionality to put the trades. This library worked best on python 3.4, and was a a great addition to QMoney stack,",
        "However, Developers in QMoney now had to run two different servers in order to run the application. It was fine so far. However, last month, the QMoney research team came up with another product that did the technical analysis on the portfolio, stocks and their historical performance, to suggest the new stocks to buy. This library was running on bleeding edge versions of Tensorflow, and required minimum versions were Ubuntu 20+ and python 3.8+",
        "This triggered a lot of issues for Qmoney developers executing end to end workflows. Now they had three servers running on the machines",

        "So you have any suggestions on how to make it work? Note down your thoughts on notepad, and watch this video.",
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi-MGFhrad0",
        "This problem becomes even challenging when you have multiple releases that work across different stacks. Think about different combinations of different versions of Java and python which you want to run on the same machine. That makes it extremely difficult to manage the ecosystems.",
        "In older days, we used to set up separate machines in the development environment in order to replicate multiple versions of a product. Very soon it became so difficult to manage, but then we came up with Virtual machines.",
        "Have you ever heard of VirtualBox or VMWare? Running Linux inside Windows? The underlying technique was called Virtualization.",

        "Install RabbitMQ",
        "Setup ports etc",
        "Of course it's not as simple as you see in the three steps above. There will be challenges on every of these steps that you will face, right from sudo privileges to user settings etc..",
        "In a nutshell, when you install a software on your system, following are the tasks done",
        "Install executables",
        "Setup default configurations",
        "Create user groups that have specialized access",
        "Setup startup/ shutdown scripts",
        "Configure system services.",
        "Moreover, Once installed, some of these configurations are irreversible.  which means there is a fair chance that even if you uninstall rabbitmq from your system, some residual components will remain..",
        "Which means, every software installed on your system pollutes your system in a way!",
        "Containers solve this problem. Assume you want to run the rabbit mq on your system, it can be done in single command",
        "Try running this command in your terminal. It will download and run a rabbitmq server in no time. While you still have to make database and other configurations, the most challenging part of prerequisites and everything else is solved.",
        "Let's take it further to our QEats application,",
        "What if you want to run QEats on the production server? This the the prerequisite",
        "Java",
        "Mongo",
        "RabbitMQ",
        "Redis etc.",
        "It would take a lot of time to install everything and run. But what if you don't want to go through that pain?",
        "And how about running it in single command?",
        "Now, open another terminal and try accessing the QEats api on port 8081?",
        "Did it work? How? Did you install anything? Then how did it work?",
        "Like all other scripts, docker also has its own scripting language, which is very similar to shell scripting.",

        "While we built only one image using the container, the images actually have three images. What are these two images about?",
        "Now, try to build the same image again",
        "This time, the command finished in milliseconds, which obviously happened because of some sort of cache. What kind of cache iis it?",
        "It's usually called layers in docker world.",
        "Introduction video to docker layers",
        "Now, let’s try to go with a little complex example. Lets say, we want to build a container from a spring boot application",
        "Here is the docker file, We will first try to understand the docker file, and then look at what happens when we run it.",
        "This spring starter has a file named ",

        "Let's take a look at the steps involved in building this image.",
        "Baseline for this image is gradle:jdk11 image available on docker hub. The details are available ",
        "Next is ARG command, that sets up a temporary environment variable which enabled non-interactive install",
        "From step 3-9 are few commands that install required softwares on the machine.",
        "Step 10 is changing the underlying user to ROOT",
        "Step 11 is a COPY command that can copy files from Host filesystem to guest filesystem",
        "Step 12 and 13 are about making another directory ",
        " and copying the contents of current directory on host os to ",
        " on the guest os.",
        "Step 14 is again another command that actually builds the copied spring application and generates a bootable jar that can be used as a server.",
        "The last line is about defining entrypoint. While you can say that everything from Step 1-14 attributes to the container image, Step 15 is executed when you start the container for the first time. When you start the container, the command mentioned as ",
        " will be executed.",
        "Let's try to create the image now.",
        "Now go to hub.docker.com,  We have the same image pushed over there. ",
        "Click on tags.",
        "Click on ",
        " and it will show the details of the docker image.",
        "Click on the commands shown there to see the details of each command",
        "Layers is nothing but something similar to ",

        "When a container starts, these changes are \"Computed\" based on layer information, and the filesystem is derived.",
        "By now, you know that containers share the file resources with host operating system, including kernel and process space.",
        "Can you push your own images to docker repository?",
        "Now, create an account on https://hub.docker.com",
        "And login from terminal",
        "Once you login, push your image using the command below",

        ". In this spirit, let’s start this activity to explore what goes on behind the scenes when web requests are served.",
        "This activity requires a laptop for optimal learning. If you are on your mobile device, you are missing out :)",
        "Let us use Chrome Developer Tools to get an inside view of all the network requests made by the browser when you visit ",
        ". The following video should help you get a quick preview of what you will be doing in this milestone!",
        "Open Developer Tools in Google Chrome using the keyboard shortcut for your operating system.",
        "Windows/Linux: ",

        ")",
        "Mac: ",
        "In Developer Tools, switch to the ",

        "In the filter section, make sure ",
        " is selected.",
        "Type ",
        " in the browser navigation bar and hit ",
        ".",
        "And, voila! Google’s home page loads on the left side.",
        "In the Developer Tools window, you can see all the network requests that were made to serve Google’s home page. (see screenshot below for a sample, each row represents a network request)",
        "Before we start digging into the details of each network request, here are a few quick questions for you. Try to answer them by observing Developer Tools on your browser.",
        "How many HTTP requests were made to serve Google’s home page?",
        "What is the size of Google’s home page?",
        "How much of this was rendered from cache?",
        "And how much was transferred over the network?",
        "How much time did it take to load Google’s homepage?",
        "The answers to these questions are in the status bar at the bottom of the Developer Tools Window.",
        "40 HTTP requests were made to serve Google’s homepage. This is not a constant number. It might have taken a few additional (or fewer) requests on your laptop.",
        "The size of a page is the sum total of the size of all resources required to render to completely.",
        "2.1 MB of resources were loaded from cache.",
        "68.3 kB was transferred over the network. These will primarily include resources that are not cacheable or those that the web page has explicitly asked the browser not to cache.",
        "It took 397 ms to load Google’s home page. This includes the time it took to download all the necessary resources required to render the page. The basic structure of the web page - the Document Object Model (",
        ") was loaded first (which took 249 ms), and the remaining resources (including Javascript libraries, images and other resources) took the remaining time (397 - 249 = 148 ms).",
        "If the speed of your internet connection doubled, which of the above answers would change?",
        "If you accessed Google’s home page from an incognito window, which of the above answers would change? Will the values go up or down? Try it out and compare the values in each case.",
        "How does the browser know what resources to cache?",
        "Assume that the logo image of a website was changed after it was cached by your browser. How would the browser know to fetch the new logo image and not its cached version?",
        "How does the browser know which resources to cache and which ones to fetch afresh when you visit the same web page multiple times? Can a web page explicitly tell the browser what parts are cacheable?",
        "We have taken a cursory look at some of the details available inside Developer Tools when network requests are made. Let’s inspect the network requests now to understand what goes on behind the scenes.",
        "Click on the first network request and try to answer the following questions:",
        "When you typed ",
        " in the browser, what ",
        " did it translate to?",
        "Is this a secure request? Or an insecure request?",
        "You will notice the following upon inspecting the ",
        " tab in Developer Tools:",
        "The browser automatically adds ",
        " (or ",
        ") to the request URL if you leave it out. It assumes that all web requests are ",
        " requests by default. Hence, ",
        " => ",
        ".",
        "This is an insecure request because it uses ",
        " and not ",
        ".",
        "HTTP is an application (layer-7) protocol. HTTP requests are made over TCP connections (at the transport layer). So, in order to make an HTTP request, you must first establish a TCP connection.",
        "A. Their IP addresses and port numbers (or at least the IP address and port number of the destination host).",
        "In our case, to access Google’s home page, we must make an HTTP request to Google’s backend web server. And for that, you must know it’s IP address.",
        "A. DNS, of course.",

        "Try both variants in Chrome and measure the time difference between them.",
        "Here are some questions based on the ",

        "Did you also get the ",

        "Are these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses?",
        "What does the ",

        "Discuss the above questions with a friend and compare your answers.",
        "For (1) and (2) above, read this interesting and relevant ",

        " button on the toolbox to see Google’s IPv6 addresses.\n",
        "Why does google.com have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses?",
        "How does the browser divide whether it should use IPv4 of IPv6 addresses to communicate with google.com? Does it use one of these always?",
        "The domain name is first resolved to fetch the corresponding IP address (which is required to make the HTTP/TCP connection, remember?).",
        "Depending on how popular the website is, a DNS load balancer will return different IP addresses from a pool of IP addresses that have been assigned to the domain. The load balancing decision could be based on a combination of geolocation, server load, and other details. (",
        ")",
        "Each IP address returned in the DNS response will take you to a different backend web server, hence enabling services like Google to serve millions of user requests simultaneously through multiple backend servers.",

        "With this, the browser has all the info it needs to make an HTTP request to ",
        ". We will cover this in the next section.",
        "Is it really a TCP connection underneath the HTTP request? How do you confirm this?",
        "The browser made a DNS request to resolve ",
        " to a relevant IP address. It has used this information to create a TCP connection to Google’s backend server. It is now time to make the HTTP request using this TCP connection.",
        "As you can see in the screenshot, a ",
        " request was made from the browser to fetch ",
        "’s home page and a response was received. In HTTP lingo, below is the description of the request being made:",
        "If you were accessing a specific path (e.g. ",
        "), it would have looked like this instead:",
        "The response returned by Google’s server was ",
        ". Hmm, that’s weird, right? Did Google move or something? Has it found a new (online) home?",
        " indicates that the resource we are trying to access (",
        " or ",

        ".",
        ".",
        "By sending this status code, the ",
        " server is asking the browser to update its cache and existing resources referring to the requested domain (",
        ") to always point to the new location instead (",
        ").",
        "In simple words, the web server is saying:",
        "Did you get a ",
        " instead of ",
        "? Type the full URL in the address bar:",
        "If you’re wondering why Chrome translated ",
        " directly to ",
        ", it is because Chrome has received (and correctly processed) a ",

        "Examine the response headers in the screenshot above and look for ",
        " and ",
        " fields just above the ",
        " field. This is Google’s server asking Chrome to remember this ",
        " for at least a month (as specified in the ",
        " value).",
        "The Chrome browser interprets this and uses the ",

        "We receive yet another redirect response: ",
        ". Did you receive the same status code or a different one?",
        " signifies a temporary redirect. In other words, browsers are not required to update their internal resources mapping ",
        " to the new location sent in the response.",
        "So, what is the new location this time? ",
        ". Google wants you to access their homepage using an HTTPS connection for security purposes. When you access a web page over HTTPS, all data exchanged with it is encrypted to prevent data theft through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. (",
        ")",
        "The Chrome browser follows the ",
        " ",
        " returned in the earlier response and makes the third request.",
        "In HTTP lingo, this is the request the browser is making this time:",
        "This time, we finally got a ",
        " response. This indicates that the browser has ",
        " made a successful request. (",
        ").",
        "Look at the headers and answer the following.",
        "Is this a secure request?",
        "What TCP port number was used to establish the HTTPS connection?",
        "What was the format of the response received from Google?",
        "If you recall the discussion on secure web connections, you will notice that ",
        " implies that a secure connection is being established. The reserved port number for HTTPS (443) is used to make this connection.",
        "Google returns an HTML page in response which is rendered by Chrome. The header gives us the info through the following setting:",
        "You can see the actual HTML response by clicking on the ",
        " tab. The ",
        " tag indicates that the response is in HTML format.",
        "And if you want to see how the browser renders this HTML page, check the ",
        " tab.",
        "Do you notice something weird in the preview above?",
        "Right! The images are missing. Where did they go? The images are seen clearly in the browser tab. However, they are missing in the ",
        " pane of Developer Tools.",
        "Any idea why they are missing? ",
        "It took nearly 40 requests to load Google’s home page, didn’t it? Images are missing in the preview of request #3 because they have not yet been loaded. The HTML version of Google’s homepage has links to the Google logo. Chrome notices the link and makes subsequent requests to fetch and load it.",
        "You can see the actual request made in the screenshot below.",
        "If you click on the HTTP request made to fetch Google’s logo, you can see the actual image being downloaded like in the screenshot below.",
        "After all the images and other assets (Javascript libraries, CSS files, and more) are downloaded, the Google homepage is rendered in its final form as shown in the browser.",
        "We finally have Google's homepage loaded and all ready to use. We can summarise the sequence of HTTP requests in layman terms as follows:",
        ": knocked on ",
        " with a ",
        " request.",
        ": \"Welcome, we’re glad you’re here. This is the wrong gate, though. Can you please go to ",
        " instead?",
        ": \"Ok, thank you.\"",
        ": knocks on ",
        " with a ",
        " request.",
        ": \"Why hello! Thank you for visiting us. This is a very open lobby and everyone can hear what we’re about to discuss. Care for some privacy? Can you please check-in at our other gate at ",
        "? There we can exchange keys and speak in a language that nobody else can understand.",
        ": \"Ooh, nice. Will see you there.\"",

        "&^%()",
        "&^%&YUFKHJVKJHLV(^%(&OUGLHJVLKJ\"",
        "...and they communicated happily ever after =)",
        "And that’s a wrap! It took 3 requests to successfully access Google’s homepage (and many subsequent requests to load all the linked assets). Let us summarise everything we have learned so far.",
        "The first thing the browser does with a URL (e.g. google.com) is perform a DNS lookup and get its IP address (e.g. ",
        " ).",
        "The IP address returned by the DNS server could be an IPv4 or IPv6 address.",
        "Popular websites use DNS load balancers to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers (based on geolocation, server load and other parameters).",
        "The browser establishes a TCP connection with the web server.",
        "For insecure web requests (",
        "), the default port is ",
        ". For secure web requests (",
        "), the default port is ",
        ".",
        "Once the underlying TCP connection is successfully established, HTTP requests are sent to the web server.",
        "There are different types of HTTP requests to perform four basic CRUD operations on resources stored on the server: ",
        "reate, ",
        "ead, ",
        "pdate and ",
        "elete.",
        "Web servers can force browsers to use ",
        " by using HTTP redirect responses (like ",
        " or ",
        ")",
        "When a successful HTTP request is made, the web server performs the requested CRUD operation and returns a success response (",
        ").",
        "The resource returned by the web server could be in any of several supported formats (e.g. HTML). The ",
        " field in the response headers is used to specify the type used (e.g. ",
        ").",
        "The browser renders the page using the HTML response. If there are linked images, scripts and/or stylesheets, they are fetched using subsequent HTTP requests until all resources have been loaded.",
        "The browser is done rendering the requested URL when all resources have been loaded successfully.",
        " But guess what, you learned all of that in ",
        ". Not by watching a video or reading a boring old tutorial, but by actually doing it yourself.",
        "Will you ever forget what you have just learned?",
        "The next time you’re giving a job interview and the interviewer asks: \"What goes on behind the scenes when you type ",
        " in the browser?\", we know you’ll be smiling in your heart as you ace the interview! =)",

        " is used to separate directories.",
        "To list the contents of a directory, you use the ",
        " command (short for ",
        "). When you run the ",
        " command without any arguments, it lists the contents of the present working directory by default.",
        "The output of the ",

        "In the above example,",

        "The destination directory can include a full path or a relative path (see the screenshot below for an illustration). This is true of the ",

        "Hmm, that’s bad :(",
        "At least we aren’t completely lost, there’s some info for us to debug. It has something to do with permissions. Remember when we used ",

        "REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Don’t worry - no one’s gonna ask you the meaning of each word :)",
        "API stands for Application Programming Interface, and unfortunately, people will ask you the meaning of each word here. An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. You don’t go into a cafe and walk straight into the kitchen to tell the chef what you wanna eat. The waiter does that for you, and that’s exactly what an API is - with the client being you, the customer and any resource that can send data, being the chef.",
        "Now, these APIs have different styles, or in more formal terms - conventions and architectures about how they are used.",
        "REST APIs are those APIs which follow the guidelines set by the REST architecture. They follow a client-server model where one software program sends a request and the other responds with some data. REST APIs commonly use the HTTP protocol to send requests & receive responses.",
        "How an API request differs from a usual HTTP request for a webpage, is in terms of the data returned. HTTP requests for webpages return HTML, CSS & JavaScript files which are rendered by the browser and displayed to the user. But, in the case of APIs, the request can be for any data (not just webpage) and the response is read by the requesting program which interprets the data.",
        "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation - how cryptic :| ) is a standard format that is easily \"understandable\" by applications and can be handled well in most languages. So the data format in REST is usually JSON. For example, an Android app can effortlessly utilize data sent by a Node.js server. XML is another popular format for data transfer between applications.",

        "The APIs shown in the video might require authentication when you try it out (Authentication is done so that a spammy bot(aka, hacker) doesn’t send ten quadrillion requests to a resource and blast its servers out. It can be caught and stopped)",

        " to format the JSON response in your browser window)",

        ")",
        "Do note, REST is one architectural pattern used, NOT the only one. There are some has beens, like SOAP and some new kids on the block, like GraphQL.

        " class for one type of message, all fields specific to the other message types will simply be untouched.",
        "If we check the ",
        ", there are separate methods for processing & delivering the varied types of messages using methods provided by ",

        ". The earlier ",

        "Execute this and see the output",
        "The ",
        " class contains elements and methods related to all 3 message types, but only some of them are required by the clients based on the message type. Even if a client (e.g. android_client_handler.py) wants only a text message, they will get all other fields in the Message object which they wouldn’t use.",
        "Extending this code with more message types will add more elements and methods in the ",
        " class, making it difficult to maintain.",
        "Another manner to go about supporting new types of messages will be to create different classes for each. Each one takes care of a single message type. Yeah! Something like carbon-copies of our ",
        " class. Each of these classes will have all the common fields & their methods as well as fields & methods specific to that message type. As the classes will only be having fields & methods they absolutely require, there won’t be any unused functionality.",

        "To add support for a new message type, we would add another new class which is independent, but with repeated fields and methods.",
        "However, the tech lead is not fully satisfied with these proposals. He thinks they are not easily maintainable. Something is missing here and they can do better.",
        "Yes, this situation is just right for Inheritance.",
        "The definition of inheritance is that the parent/base class holds the common fields and methods, while the child classes get to inherit the parent’s fields and methods and add their own on top of it.",
        "That way each child class (representing one message type) remains independent of other child classes.",
        "This implementation is available inside the ",
        " directory.",
        "Inside ",
        ", we use a ",
        " parent class to define fields & their methods which are common to all types of messages. E.g. message id, sender, receiver etc.",
        "For each of the message types, namely, Text, Image & Voice, we create new children classes ",
        ", ",
        " & ",
        ". These children classes inherit the ",
        " class and hence need only add any fields and methods specific to them.",

        "Clean class structure for the child classes that are easily maintainable. Each message type can be modified without impacting other classes since it holds fields/methods specific to itself.",
        "The Clients get only the fields and methods for the message type they are interested in by creating an object of the child class. This is in contrast to getting all fields by creating an object of a large single Message class, as was the case with Proposal 1 earlier.",
        "Execute this and see the output",
        "Pay close attention to these lines of code.",
        "Note that with the Inheritance based design, the invocation of the methods need to know which exact message type to use. This is not very good.",

        "Each of the Clients have their own Handlers on the Backend Server to handle requests. These Handlers read and update common structures so that any change made from one of the clients is accessible by the other.",
        "The User Preference object is one such common structure. It stores the user’s preferences.",
        "Currently, User Preferences include two fields - country and preferred language.",

        " → handler function for Android application queries",
        " → calls the Android/iOS handler code for demonstration",
        "Let’s understand the code a bit more.We’ll start with ",
        "Two of the user preferences we support now are the user’s country & their preferred language. The ",
        " file contains methods to update these fields:",
        " → read current user preferences from json file, update country of ",

        " and update the json file.",
        "Note: We are currently storing the user preference data in a json file for demonstration. In the real world, it may get stored in a database.",
        "Coming to the Handler functions, the ",
        " has some methods, including one to change the user’s country preference and another to change the user’s language preference. It uses the ",
        " function provided by ",
        " to change the user’s country and the ",
        " function to change the user’s language.",
        "Can you check the android handler at ",
        ", which supports similar methods?",
        "We are going with a simpler implementation for our current purpose and will use the ",
        " file as a proxy to call the handlers.",
        "The user preferences are stored in JSON format in ",
        " file. Each entry can contain upto three fields with language & country preference along with the username. It gets populated when we run ",
        " (as specified in the ",
        " task). Try deleting its contents and see what happens when you run the ",
        " file again.",
        "With the existing user preferences, some users end up changing the language to one that they don’t know (by mistake or maybe to fool around!). Then, they struggle to change it back resulting in a few customer complaints.",
        "To address this, a new feature has been requested by the customer service team - to restrict the languages based on the country chosen.",
        "If the user chooses a language that is not supported for his/her choice of country, an error is thrown and no update is made.",
        "2 countries are currently supported - India and USA.",
        "3 languages are currently supported - English, Hindi and Spanish.",
        "When the clients send the country and preferred language to the backend server, it needs to do the following validation, before updating the user preferences:",
        "If a user chooses India, the user can only choose between English and Hindi as the preferred language.",

        "The user preference updates made from an iOS mobile client works correctly - setting the user preferences with validation.",
        "However, updates made from the Android client are not consistent. The Preferences don’t get updated correctly.",
        "Our updated implementation is available inside the ",
        " directory. We’re getting this error when we run the ",
        " file which utilizes the handler methods to change user preferences.",

        " file was run",
        "That’s weird. Americans do speak Spanish!",
        "As the ",
        " method is inside our newly implemented Android handler, that is where we need to check. Can you figure out the bug by looking at the implementation of  ",
        " in ",
        "?",
        "Were you able to find the bug?",
        "Aha, incorrect language combination was the culprit. Americans don’t speak Hindi, right?\nThe code was missing the LANGUAGE_SPANISH validation under COUNTRY_USA and was using LANGUAGE_HINDI instead.",
        "Taking a step back to understand the cause of the issue, we can see that similar functionality (eg: to update language) is present in both of the handlers.",
        "This can lead to inconsistent behavior.",
        "Results in code duplication which makes maintenance difficult. Whenever a new change is to be implemented related to the user preferences, the developer needs to work out the changes for each of the handlers separately.",
        "We saw what encapsulation is in the ",
        " section earlier. Is our current implementation encapsulated?",
        "Nope. The handlers are triggering an update to the country and language fields directly. Each one is implementing its own validation logic.",
        "Repeating code is never good. It is better to have common methods in one place, which can be used by all other methods.",
        "What is the best place to put a method?",
        "A method should be placed closed to its relatives. If you are using classes, all methods that work on the data fields in that class should be within the class itself, making it a cohesive unit. This is precisely what encapsulation offers!",
        "The main advantage is this. The data fields of the class will not be modified from outside methods. This puts the state of the class object in the hands of the methods it exposes. So, the object stays in control. It is its own master.",
        "Note: In Java, the ",
        " access specifier can be used to hide the data fields from outside access.",
        "We have answered the ",
        " about encapsulation, let’s look at the ",
        " in the next section.",
        "Let’s see how to re-design our current implementation to satisfy encapsulation.",
        "We have an Encapsulation based implementation of our country-language validation inside the ",
        " file as the ",
        " class. Class? Yeah, we’ve enclosed everything related to user preferences in a class. Let’s check the methods provided by the class",
        " - empty constructor for the class i.e, we’ll be able to create objects without passing any parameters. But, isn’t ",
        " a parameter? Hmm, not really! ",
        " denotes the object itself.",
        " - constructor that takes in parameters. We can see that ",
        " is a mandatory parameter and the other two defaults to ",
        " if not provided",
        " - wraps our validation logic which the handlers will now be utilizing for updating the user’s language preference",
        " - utility method to update user’s country preferences",
        " - stores the user preferences to the ",
        " file. The leading ",
        " in the method name denotes the method isn’t to be used outside of the class.",
        " - Hidden method to read current user preferences from the ",
        " file.",
        "You might be thinking, \"Why are the variable names starting with ",
        ", don’t you like normal names?\"",
        "This is just a naming convention in python, which signifies that the field is not supposed to be accessed directly from outside the class.",
        "If you check our new handler implementations, you’d see that both of them are using the same method, ",
        " of the ",
        " class to update the user's language preference. The handler doesn't need to worry about how the user language is updated anymore.",
        "Run the ",
        " file & verify the contents of the user_preferences.json file is correct",
        "What are the different places we now need to check when the update language feature doesn’t work as expected? Just one, right?",
        "Not only was code duplication avoided but also the developers working on the handlers can do their job and let the class methods (who know their own class variables better), do their job.",
        "The new feature is clearly becoming a hit. With data available for the user’s country & preferred language, we are able to provide a much more personalized experience to the users. It’s time to open up our application to a much wider audience - add support for 2 more countries and 4 more languages with specific validation.",
        "With the encapsulation based code, isn’t it much easier to implement than before?",
        "Welcome to the encapsulation enlightened world! :)",
        "Practical scenarios",
        "Data gets passed between method/function calls all the time. With increasing complexity, we will end up passing more and more variables between methods which are related to a common cause. It is best to model these variables as a single object and pass the object between the methods. Encapsulation ensures only the necessary sections of the object are modifiable across all the methods.",
        "Simple example: Passing variables to represent a matrix - a 2D array, number of rows, number of columns - can be replaced by a matrix object.",
        "Another example: A product for sale has these fields - price, category, discount percentage, vendor name etc. These can be modeled as an object with methods to change the price, discount etc.",
        "Having encapsulation ensures that situations like renaming of a variable doesn’t impact the external methods that are using the class method to get or set this variable.",
        "Summary of Encapsulation",
        "Encapsulation is achieved by the object making its state (data fields) restricted to private access. External objects cannot access them directly. They can only access the state through the methods exposed by the objects.",
        " is it useful? - Sets the stage to restrict access to data fields and keeps the object in control of what fields can be modified and how. Ensures consistent behavior across users of this object.",
        " to apply? - While designing any class that has data fields and needs methods to be supported for their reading or modification.",
        " to apply? - Provide public methods for reading or updating the data fields in the class only as needed. E.g. get() or set() methods.",
        "What is the drawback if we don’t use encapsulation? - Duplication of code. Low maintainability. Inconsistent behavior. Difficult to test. Possible inappropriate access/modification from external methods.",
        "Language specific notes",
        "In Python, we name our variables starting with dunders(",
        ") to explicitly mark them as hidden variables as Python doesn’t support this behaviour by default.",
        "More OOPS aligned programming languages like C++/Java/Ruby provide access modifiers like public/private that we can utilize effectively to achieve encapsulation. Here, getter/setter methods are portals to the class state.",
        "General encapsulation notes",
        "Restricts direct access to data members of a class.",
        "Fields are set to private if language supports it, else treated as such",
        "Each field has a getter and setter method",
        "Getter methods return the field",
        "Setter methods let us change the value of the field",
        "Does prefixing variables with dunders (",
        ") in Python like we did really make them hidden from outside access? Is there some way to still access & manipulate them?",

        " directory. Currently, we’re going with the JSON format to store our configurations as it is pretty common & easy to deal with.",
        "We have many product teams that have to deal with multiple types of configuration. All of them have similar implementations that utilize the ",
        " class methods, for reading/storing specific configuration from/to disk as JSON. For example, the Inventory team’s config handler is ",

        " method we saw earlier to work its magic!",

        "Some teams want to move towards XML file based configuration instead of JSON, since XML supports a good set of tools to build, encode, validate and build schemas.",
        "Sample XML file",
        "Not exactly easy for us to read, right? Though XML compromises on human-readability it comes with its advantages as we saw earlier.",
        "One way to implement XML support is to add new methods to read & write XML configuration files inside our ",
        " class. Teams can then utilize these methods.",
        "This version can be found inside the ",
        " directory",
        "If we look inside ",

        " from ",
        ". Similarly, for the write method as well.",
        "The Logistics team has shifted to XML based configuration, while the Inventory and Vendor teams stay with JSON.",
        "Let’s also check how the implementation of the Logistics team changed in ",
        ".",
        "Ok, they had to change their original implementation by modifying the method names and parameters at multiple places.",
        "Try running the ",
        " file",
        "Compare the contents of ",
        " file, that was just created with the ",
        " file from our earlier implementation. Same configuration, different format, right?",
        "The above design works but has some disadvantages.",
        "Adding support for another file type will involve creating even more methods in config_manager.py, making it cluttered. For now, we have renamed previous methods and added two new methods.",
        "The Clients using this code need to make corresponding changes to method names and parameter values, which might be getting invoked in multiple places.",
        "With the implementation in the previous milestone, we see that new methods were put into the config_manager class. This keeps the implementation in one place. However, with more and more methods being added, the config_manager is catering to multiple use cases which are better off in their own class. Having their own class will make it easier to maintain and have clear responsibilities.",
        "Also, the users explicitly need to use method names based on the file type and are no longer generic. If they are making this call in multiple places, users would need to replace all occurrences, if they need to change the file type.",
        "Abstraction addresses these shortcomings by clearly defining a common method signature. Separate classes can implement the same method but internally read the file type of choice. From a user perspective, the methods don’t change based on file type and it is easy to change from one type to another with minimal changes.",
        "Let’s go through an Abstraction driven design for this requirement to see how it is better.",

        " are to be changed in all places they’re used.",
        "This redesigned version can be found inside the ",
        " directory.",
        "To combat the first issue, we go with an abstract class ",
        " inside ",
        ". Abstract class? Yeah, we won’t provide any implementation in this class, just the method names. Other classes will then implement these methods based on the file types they need to support.",
        "Let’s look at what the method definitions are trying to say",
        " - sets an abstract method ",
        " which takes a single parameter, ",
        " denoting the configuration file name. No, ",
        " isn’t another parameter but just denotes object of the ",
        " class itself",
        " - defines the abstract method ",
        " which takes two parameters, configuration file name & the configuration data to be written to the config file.",
        "Now, the fancy annotation ",
        " along with the ",
        " method is required as Python doesn’t support abstract classes by default.",
        "Now we have the method signature required for reading & writing configuration laid out clearly. Each configuration file type can be supported by a subclass of the ",
        " class which will implement the specific read/write functionality of that type.",
        "You can see that we have a class each for dealing with the JSON & XML configurations. Let’s check the  ",
        " file.",
        "Some points we can comprehend from the code",
        "The ",

        "They don’t want to use the functionality provided by some of the methods in the base class. The teams want to implement their own functionality for some of these methods.

        "Yeah, something like",
        "We can see that the criteria set by the TextMessage team is that the message size to be at most 100 for it to be considered a valid message. The ImageMessage team is more moderate about the condition for an image message to be valid & is only checking if the message has any content.",
        "As the methods were implemented independently by different teams, we can see a difference in the method names used.",

        "Every time a new message type is introduced or teams want to have their own implementation, the Clients would need to make code changes.",

        "What if the entity property is longer in words? For example, let’s assume there the entity has properties: ",
        " which signifies city of birth, ",
        " which is for date of birth and ",
        " which is for current city of residence. How will you put this in a method that uses all three as criteria? Is the method name ",
        " correct?",
        ": All the method parsing algorithm needs is a way to differentiate between the criteria. The default is to use camel case as a delimiter, which means you have to use a different delimiter in the above method name. How to do this?",
        "The repository method returns ",
        ", but the username is generally unique in a forum. How would you change the method to return a single user document? Can you try it out?",
        "In this form, the method name is not parsed. Instead, you add a ",
        " annotation to the method and specify a MongoDB json query string.",
        "For example, in the previous task, you used",
        "as the method name which needed to be parsed. Using the query annotation route, its form can be changed to something that looks like this:",
        "Let’s break this down:",
        "The first thing to be observed is that the method name does not play a part here in generating the query here.",
        "The ",
        " in the json query string is the entity property, and the ",
        " is the value you want to give to the criteria. This value is taken from the method parameter. The \"0\" here indicates that it is the first parameter in the query method that should be used as the value. Similarly, you would expect to write ",
        ", ",
        " and so on should more method parameters by used.",
        "With the ",
        " annotation, you gain more power as it is more expressive but the tradeoff for this is that you lose the ease and convenience of the query methods from before. The other tradeoff is that there is a tighter coupling between the query and the underlying technology of the data store as we must know the query semantics of the store.",
        "Let’s take a look at the implementation of the use case where this is utilized.",
        "The objective is to get users whose posts contain the string \"cricket\" in their post content. To do this, you need to search for the string inside an array of posts for every user document. This is not straightforward to do using a query method. But we can turn to the expressive power of ",
        " annotation to solve this problem.",
        "The code in the repository service is as follows:",
        "And the repository method with the annotation is:",
        "Of course, you are not limited to regex operators. You are only limited by the query capabilities offered by mongo. Thus the method annotation form offers pretty much the full expressive power of querying directly on MongoDB.",
        "How many posts contain the word \"ipl\"?",
        "Can you try searching for posts that have a substring ",
        " order it by the time of post creation?",
        "The third form of querying the database that Spring Data offers is MongoTemplate. With each increasing step you have taken, you have traded convenience for expressiveness and flexibility. MongoTemplate is the most powerful form, allowing you to construct dynamic, ad-hoc queries which offer granular control over the other forms.",
        "Let’s go through a previous use case - get users by username.",
        "Let’s break down this usage:",
        "There are three objects here: ",
        " object, ",
        " object, ",
        " object. The ",
        " and ",
        " objects have a fluent style API which makes it easy to chain together criteria and queries programmatically. This offers one big advantage over the other forms: You can construct queries ",
        " Previously, you were effectively limited to \"hard-coded\" queries which means if you query had to be changed based on some system condition, it was not possible unless there was already another query method that could be selected. With this chainable API, you can construct queries in an ad-hoc fashion.",
        "Once the query is created, mongoTemplate can be used to execute the query. Notice the ",
        " method. If you remember your mongo queries, it should be familiar. There are a whole host of methods ",
        " has to help you beside this one.",
        "The answer as always is: It depends. If your queries do not change much, or are relatively straightforward you may prefer query methods. If you want full flexibility to write your own ad-hoc queries, ",
        " may be more preferable. You could also go for a mixed approach through proper layering and decoupling, where you could start off with the relatively simple repository query methods and then start adopting MongoTemplate as and when more expressive queries are required."

        "Not exactly easy for us to read, right? Though XML compromises on human-readability it comes with its advantages as we saw earlier.",

        "The Logistics team has shifted to XML based configuration, while the Inventory and Vendor teams stay with JSON.",
        "Let’s also check how the implementation of the Logistics team changed in ",
        ".",
        "Ok, they had to change their original implementation by modifying the method names and parameters at multiple places.",

        "Compare the contents of ",
        " file, that was just created with the ",
        " file from our earlier implementation. Same configuration, different format, right?",
        "The above design works but has some disadvantages.",
        "Adding support for another file type will involve creating even more methods in ",
        ", making it cluttered. For now, we have renamed previous methods and added two new methods.",
        "The Clients using this code need to make corresponding changes to method names and parameter values, which might be getting invoked in multiple places.",
        "With the implementation in the previous milestone, we see that new methods were put into the ",
        " class. This keeps the implementation in one place. However, with more and more methods being added, the ConfigManager is catering to multiple use cases which are better off in their own class. Having their own class will make it easier to maintain and have clear responsibilities.",
        "Also, the users explicitly need to use method names based on the file type and are no longer generic. If they are making this call in multiple places, users would need to replace all occurrences, to change the file type.",
        "Abstraction addresses these shortcomings by clearly defining a common method signature. Separate classes can implement the same method but internally read the file type of choice. From a user perspective, the methods don’t change based on file type and it is easy to change from one type to another with minimal changes.",
        "Let’s go through an Abstraction driven design for this requirement to understand how it is better.",

        " are to be changed in all places they’re used.",
        "This redesigned version can be found inside the ",
        " directory.",
        "To combat the first issue, we go with an interface",
        " inside ",
        ". Interface? Yeah, we won’t provide any implementation in this class, just the method names. Other classes will then implement these methods based on the file types they need to support.",
        "Let’s look at what the method definitions are trying to say",
        " - sets an abstract method ",
        " which takes two parameters, ",
        " denoting the configuration file name. ",
        " denotes the configuration type’s class. For MySql, this will be the ",
        " class",
        " - defines the abstract method ",
        " which takes two parameters, configuration file name & the configuration data to be written to the config file.",
        "Now we have the method signature required for reading & writing configuration laid out clearly. Each configuration file type can be supported by a class that implements the interface provided by ",
        ". This class will implement the specific read/write functionality for that type.",
        "You can see that we have a class each for dealing with the JSON & XML configurations. Let’s check the  ",
        " file.",
        "Some points we can understand from the code",
        "The ",
        " class is a subclass of the ",
        " interface",
        "It implements both of the abstract methods defined in ",
        "Similarly, we have the implementation for the XML type configuration in ",
        "All done, right? Hmm, Not really!",
        "Our earlier implementation had one more drawback - we were dealing with the issue of having to change method names and parameter values in all previous implementations, whenever support for a new config file type was added. This made the code harder to maintain.",
        "How did we deal with this in our new implementation based on Abstraction?",
        "Taking a look at the Logistics team’s implementation in ",
        "As the Logistics team moved to using XML, they are creating an object of the ",
        " class and using its methods to read and write configuration XML.",
        "What would the Logistics team need to do if they were having second thoughts to go back to JSON? They’d just need to change ",
        " to an object of type ",
        " instead of  ",
        ". Done!",
        "Right-click inside ",
        " and select ",
        " to run the file.",
        "New requirements have come in. We need to add support for storing configuration in CSV files and also in a Database.",
        "How easy or difficult is it (with the abstraction based design) to add this support?",
        "Practical scenarios",
        "The Java Virtual Machine is an abstraction. Your code can use the exact same java methods irrespective of whether your code will run on Linux or Windows or any other OS. Underneath, a lot of things will change depending on the OS, which the user doesn’t need to know.",
        "You can use a simple API call to fetch weather data or stock prices. These API abstract out the internal complexities of how it is implemented.",
        "Software libraries are good examples of abstraction. They tell you the methods you can use without telling you how they are implemented.",
        "Summary of Abstraction",
        "It separates the method signature from its implementation.",
        "Closely related classes can separate out common fields/methods into a different class and reuse that class.",
        " is it useful? - To the implementers of the class, it is useful since it provides them with the flexibility to change things as long as the method signatures don’t change. For the users, it keeps them from getting exposed to anything other than the method signatures they need to know, reducing complexity.",
        " to apply? - Use a smaller set of public methods",
        "What is the drawback if we don’t use abstraction? - Low maintainability because responsibilities are not clearly differentiated. Higher Complexity with larger code bases because many objects interact with others and it becomes difficult to add functionality without impacting others.",

        "With any codebase that you work on, it is difficult to debug an error by remembering all the functionality of different classes or how they interacted with each other. Proper utilisation of exception handling procedures can save you a lot of debugging time by including more information when an error is seen.",

However, the reduction in storage costs and massive amounts of unstructured data have paved the way for NoSQL based databases. In a lot of cases where it is not required to deal with complex relational data models that occur due to the large number of tables and the relationships between them, NoSQL comes into play.

        "MongoDB is one of the more popular NoSQL databases in use today.",
        "Understand the need for MongoDB",
        "Learn Mongo shell commands",
        "To start the ",
        ", execute ",
        " in the terminal. You’ll see an output similar to the below snapshot.",
        "Note: All Mongo commands covered in this Byte are to be executed while inside the Mongo shell (unless specified otherwise).",
        "It is schema-free and does away with the need to define a fixed structure. You can just start adding data and it isn’t necessary to have any relation between those. The only restriction with this is the supported data structures.",
        "The document format used in place of rows and columns can be easily mapped by programming languages",
        "Horizontally scalable i.e, data can be distributed across multiple servers to improve performance whereas for relational databases, performance can only be improved by increasing the performance of the server it’s run on.",
        "Provides good support for Hierarchical data like JSON or XML. For large amounts of unstructured data, SQL based DB would be significantly slower.",
        "Offers higher efficiency and reliability which in turn helps with better storage capacity and speed requirements.",
        "Let’s look at some of these in more detail",
        "Let’s take an example of some data to be stored in a database. See the data below, for the weather forecast for London city on January 30, 2017 (given by the \"dt\" ",
        ").",
        "Come up with the different tables that would be required to store this data in a relational (SQL) database.",
        "These tables will be required - Coordinates, Weather, Main, Wind, Clouds, Sys and one parent table which has foreign key relationship to all these other tables.",
        "So, we need to come up with the tables to be used, set data types for all the attributes, define the relationships, and create all these tables before going ahead and adding data to these tables. This is termed as having a \"fixed schema\" as the structure is defined before adding data.",
        "MongoDB uses dynamic schema and inherently supports hierarchical data (nested data) as it’s a NoSQL database. This means that the schema (structure) is dynamically created from the data and individual data entries don't have to be in the same format. Hence, there’s no overhead to adding complex data like we saw above, making it a preferred choice to store this kind of data.",
        "As MongoDB can be scaled horizontally, MongoDB clusters can be geographically distributed on servers to improve query performance.",
        "MongoDB is a persistent (or disk-based) database unlike Redis, which is a NoSQL based in-memory database. Though Redis can be significantly faster than MongoDB when the stored data is smaller in size, MongoDB can operate much faster as the database gets larger.",
        "Sharding is the concept of storing partitions of data (shard) in different database servers.",
        "For sharding in relational databases like MySQL, application level changes are required as well as needing to suffer downtime due to interlinking of the tables. These also require servers with high specifications which are costly.",
        "Due to the horizontal scalability, sharding in MongoDB is cost-effective as buying several low-cost machines is often cheaper than buying a smaller number of machines with significantly higher specifications.",
        "Additionally, MongoDB stores data in the BSON (Binary JSON) format.",
        "BSON basically is an improvised version of the popular JSON format used",
        "BSON supports additional data types like Date out of the box in addition to the data types like String, Boolean, Number, Array supported by JSON.",
        "Parsing data is much quicker with BSON as data isn’t saved in text form (human-readable) as in JSON. BSON adds metadata to like lengths of string used to make queries faster",
        "As popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python has data types (",
        ", ",
        ") to which JSON can be directly mapped, it removes any transformation required to process the data.",
        "However, in the below cases, Relational databases are a better bet than NoSQL databases",
        "If large amount of structured data is to be written and it’s critical to avoid loss of data",
        "If the structure of data may not change, \"fixed schema\" of relational databases can be better even with the overhead of designing the schema as it becomes possible to perform complex queries using SQL",
        "If storage is an issue and need to avoid data redundancy",
        "We’ll be using a practical scenario of storing and processing data for QTravels, which is a Hotel Booking portal. As you can imagine, for a large travel website, there will be innumerable subsystems that work in unison to give the end user a great experience. We’ll look at the Reservations component of the website.",

        "Thanks. Now, I’m able to create new ",
        " objects. But, there’s a new issue now. I’m having trouble retrieving & updating the values of the variable for objects of this class. Google told me I have to define getter & setter methods for ",
        " variables as they are \"private\" for the class defining it.",
        ". I’d like to have the ability to access & modify all these private variables.",
        "Nice! I’m going crazy modifying ",

        "Are you able to run the commented code in the ",

        "(Quick note if you are highly adventurous: don’t get started with adding those methods. Save it for the next milestone!)",
        "Lombok provides annotations (yeah, the things we put on top of classes/fields) for auto-generating boiler-plate code. This is achieved by injecting in the required things directly to the ",

        " folder as well, how does it compare with what you were doing earlier?",
        "Very cool, right? Can we do even better?",
