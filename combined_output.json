        "transcription": "I was working as a project engineer in the group prior to Cryo, I was from electronics background. I was looking for some opportunities in software development and I saw that Cryo had some great projects to showcase. When I saw the Cryo portfolio, I really liked the things that we would be doing in Cryo, like building some great projects over here. The modules that were It's like how someone from a team would give you the task to do, that was very similar to what we would do on our real job. The projects, they do obviously add some value to your resume. For your resume to get shortlisted, it's important you make your resume in a structured manner. The articles and the blogs presented, that really helped that what we should be presenting in our resume. Apart from projects also, it's very necessary that you develop problem-solving skills. I found that DSM modules were also very important in solving those problems. In most of the DSM problems, I found that the checklist and the follow-up list that were given at the bottom of the form. That really helped in building up the thought process in how we would be approaching the problem. I would suggest that first build out things and see first of all if you really like it or not. Try to build some good projects. That really helped me to make the resume the way that I wanted."

        "transcription": "Okay, folks, hope you're enjoying the stage one of cryovintroff doing, I see the Slack channel just like going crazy. And congrats again for breaking down Git for a couple of days back. Let's see what we can do today. All right. To start off with, we're going to quickly go over cloud. And we're going to simplify it to a very, very basic extent so that you have a starting point for what is cloud. And tomorrow, let's say that you have a conversation and then there is your friend who just like comes and keeps boasting about all these words around you, right? The first and foremost thing is to actually not be afraid of those words. And then understand that they're just like some technology that you can just like pick up in a day or two, right? So that's going to be the primary goal for today. I'm going to just like quickly set some context on what is cloud? Why are people generally going kind of like crazy about it, right? Why are companies actually going crazy about it rather than individuals and how it's changing the entire startup landscape. So we'll start off with some very quick examples and then hopefully by the end of the session you'd have a starting point of how to go about learning cloud. All right, let's get started. So a quick recap of today's Friday and for a lot of people it's going to be end of the week, but it's going to be a hectic weekend for us, right? So we are here for the Demystify in cloud session. Tomorrow we have this full stack sprint and it's going to be about say 24 to 36 hours where you'll be introduced to full stack architecture and you'll be building your own profile. All right. It's going to be a lot of fun. The session starts at 11 o'clock and then there'll be one more session around the evening. That's not 4am. It's 4pm. And then the next day we'll have Sunday also we'll have one more session. All right. Other than that, we also have a big variable. series talk with Karan from Github. So that's also going to be very interesting because he's going to talk about how the Github profiles are actually standing for a resume today. Okay, it's going to be a lot of fun for you guys. All right, we'll get started. So as I said, very quickly, what is cloud advantages and then how to learn cloud. Okay. So what is cloud? Just like pause here for 10 seconds. I'll see the answers. What is cloud? Just type your answers. Whatever you know about cloud, why it exists. I'm very sure some of you type about the real cloud, but I'm talking about the compute and you know, tech cloud. All right. Let's see. Let's start with a couple of stories. I love stories. Okay. So some somebody I know, he commutes to office every day. He doesn't do it anymore because of COVID. But otherwise, he does commute to office every day. This is about roughly 10 kilometers from his home. Okay. And he has a not so boring life, I would say. He probably goes out on Saturday nights for partying and that's about it. He just likes it as a house. Okay. So given this is how Som is, what would you recommend him? Would you actually ask him to buy a car or would you just like ask him to take Uber every day? If you were Som, what would you do? Let's see. And as usual, try to explain why, right? If you say Uber, that's fine. But tell why. If you say you should buy a car, tell why. Okay. That would be more interesting, right? I'm sure both options are are equally viable. Right. But that really depends, right? Like, as a different for different use cases, you need different kind of solutions. Over here. Generally, if you're to see that his need is very, very less, his car is going to be unused for most parts of the time, right? Like as soon as he comes to office, he has like hectic work. So which means that this car is kind of laying out idle, and it's not a huge distance as well, right? So owning a car might be much, much more expensive, right? Compared to he actually just like renting a car, right? So simple equation is something like on demand, you get and then you just like return the resource back as cloud and then you having your own thing as the general you buying your own car, as simple as that, right? In in the general terminology as well, cloud is essentially you using somebody's resources, it could be storage, it could be compute, right? Or it could be anything else, you use their service, right? on demand and then whenever you don't need it you just like return it back. I think of the advantages of doing this right say let's say one weekend he plans to go to some court or something now he can actually get a SUV for rent but if he is owning his own car he can't do that which means in a similar analogy in cloud if you want really a huge machine on one weekend alone you can always rent out a huge machine instead of having to purchase that huge machine right that's exactly where cloud comes into picture. Now another story Achana I hope you all know her already she is probably answering a lot of your questions right now she's a photographer I hope she is I don't know she just like takes pics of every single thing she sees okay and you know what her hard disks are like this she has like all company hard disks just like all scattered over and every week she's so so particular about you know having her photos safeguarded she just like takes a picture. periodic backups and not just like one one hard disk right she takes backup on one hard disk what if that just like falters right so she takes one copy locally and then you know she puts it in his parents home and then takes couple of more copies puts it on different shelves because they are so precious to her right how does it sound any of you do this do any of you do this today by the way this was the case few years back so kind of taking so many photos they of course like mobile has changed things a bit but even otherwise if you're a digital camera lover each of the photos kind of like pretty huge right and if you're used to taking so much photos the only solution you had was to actually take backups periodically you have some external hard drives and then like whatever 500 GB whatever hard disk was available right you take periodic backups and you have to safeguard that right it's it's for just like your own personal photos right think of something that is much more sensitive where you can't really afford to lose the data then the kind of effort you have to put in to actually safeguard that is really really huge correct now what is she doing these days she has moved on to cloud right she has moved on to personal cloud solutions in here example could be say Google photos or iCloud what what what happens once she moves there does she care where Google photos store her photos does she really care not really right as long as there's a way for her to access right like she goes types in her username password all the photos are displayed as long as she can do that she doesn't care where Google photos stores the photos and it could be in Germany it could be in India Australia who cares right does she care about which brand of hard disk they use not really right but when you make a purchase you have to find out okay hey Seagate is like really good but like very expensive say Western Digital maybe you know what it's there, right? Or maybe Samsung hard disk. I don't know whatever you want to try, right? You read so many reviews before actually making a purchase. But here she doesn't care about any of these. As long as Google Photos guarantees that your photos will not go away, right? She doesn't care which brand of hard disk they use, how many copies they make. She doesn't care, right? Same thing with like how to keep the hard disk secure, no theft, right? Nothing like that. All of it is outsourced to somebody else, that is Google, and then Google takes care of everything, right? So this is exactly where cloud comes into picture, right? This is called personal cloud, where you don't actually store everything or you don't maintain some of these hardware. All you do is you get a service from some cloud provider, and then they take care of every single thing for you, right? So this is comparable to the hard disk example. Now, I hope that helps you understand what is cloud, right? Essentially a leased resource or... a resource on rent, whatever type of resource it is, it could be computers, or it could be just a storage. It could be say some services like say you could actually rent load balancers, right? You could rent, say, like Kafka service, MySQL, you could just like do anything you want, right? You could you either get a software as a service, or you could get a hardware as a service, anything related to tech, you can actually get it. All right. Now, what are the advantages? There are a lot more, but I'm just going to focus on three main ones. Okay. These three just like helps you understand like, when a normal day to day ingenious life, why do they come into picture? So first, all of you know about the Netflix stream fest? How many of you watch the or join the Netflix for free on 5th and 6th December 2020? Did any of you take free accounts? I'm sure. I'm sure a lot of you would have done that and probably finished a couple of series as well, right? If you're used to, say, some sort of a torrent solutions, this kind of like a boom, two days, you can just like watch every single serial that you want. Most of you must have been watched as well. Right? Now, even by conservative numbers, right, let's say that each movie takes about or each series, whatever, right, one or two or types, I think takes about one GB, right? Now, all this has to be streamed, right? It's not like just storing, but it has to be streamed. And between these two days alone, okay, there are reports that says like they had about eight lakh new users or 800k new users, right? That's quite a number of users. What did you think Netflix did to actually get these servers? Or how many servers did they have to deploy? Think of it, right? Your marketing team is planning an event. And you know that on those two days, the traffic is going to be crazy. Same thing with Big Billion Dales, Big Billion billion day sale for say Flipkart or Amazon has its own kind of sale offer right now only during those two days or a week they are going to have so much of traffic maybe 10x their normal traffic correct and they do some math then they find out okay you know what I need 10k servers for this right 10,000 servers for this whatever math they do now do you think that they are going to buy 10,000 servers just for these two days that doesn't sound right like let's say they buy 10,000 servers what is that going to happen on 7th of December our Netflix employees going to get some like Christmas gifts some servers for them to play games not really right so this is where flexible resource scaling comes into picture right all Netflix had to do was okay hey you know what Amazon I just like need 10k servers okay each of the server I need say 8 core processor and 32 gig ram 1TB hard disk right SSD. That's it. The moment it's it kind of communicates that to Amazon easy to again to configurations, things are automatically automatically going to be ramped up on Amazon. Right? If there are like say 10k servers, Amazon is going to give 10k servers for those two days to Netflix. And two days later, they don't need any of them. They just like returning back. That's it. Right. And the beauty, the beauty of this is that it's not even that they have to get all 10k in bulk. Okay, the traffic probably during the nights are going to be higher on other parts of the time, probably not that much. So it can just like scale up and down based on demand. If there are say 10,000 users watching maybe they have say 200 servers. And then let's say the load increases on the Netflix server, right? Automatically it can scale up. Let's say from 1000 servers or whatever number of servers they can scale to 2000 servers, then 3000 servers, right? It hits the peak of 10k servers, whenever  the load goes down, they automatically return the servers back to Amazon EC2, which means Netflix gets or gets what it wants, like high, very high peak load, which is like say 10 x of their regular traffic, and they are only paying for what they use, they do not have to buy hardware just for two days of the year, that is amazing. So that is where this whole, the resource scaling capability, that is really one of the key reasons why cloud is so famous. Let us see the next one, how about resource management, it might sound quite a bit funny, but like, think of what you did to host your own server, you did host your own server, like by the way, with QEats, what did you have to do, did you actually buy some hardware or get a public IP from your ISP, even getting a static public IP? public IP from your ISP takes time. You have to actually buy it and then pay some extra money to them every month. You don't have to buy server hardware. You don't have to do any like let's say you have been running the server for quite some time. You don't have to actually update the hardware or upgrade the software. You don't have to do any of those. Do you care about whether or not your server would have uninterrupted power supply? We all know how it is. If you're at home or even if in office, you have to be conscious about the UPS. Except for hospitals, it's kind of like very expensive to have like completely uninterrupted power supply. And how about the internet? With just like one connection, it's not good enough if you had to just like have an airtel internet connection. You should have like multiple internet connections so that if airtel goes down, maybe Tata comes up. So, which means there are a lot of nuances just to keep a server up and running. Cooling solutions, physical solutions. security think of it right your server should not be stolen it has a lot of sensitive data. So if just to have a bunch of servers running for your company let's say you are running a company just to have a bunch of servers running for your company takes quite a bit of effort you have to pay somebody right you have IT admins whom you pay just to maintain these let's say some system has to be rebooted maybe they are physically they are going and doing a reboot right lot of these things were done in the past okay this is how it used to work we used to have a company and a company there used to be a server room where all these things are maintained and then people manually they go they wear these shoes they go there and then they have stools like I mean just like the one you see over here manually do all these things this is real right now what you are doing if you were to think about what you had done to deploy a Qt server didn't have to do any of these right all you said was okay docker run tuk tuk tuk that's it what like before that the steps you would have taken was you go to eat you went to eat aws ec2 instance ec2 is just like think of it as a uh virtual machine okay you say okay hey i want i don't think half of you would have even noticed that you said okay i want ubuntu and then you selected i want two core or four core machine or eight gig machine right there was some default selected so it's just like press tuk tuk tuk and then went ahead to the next steps it configured some security it assigned it some storage 10 gig hard disk 20 gig hard disk right you don't have to touch a thing you didn't buy anything all you did was a bunch of button clicks some server got configured it was given to you with the configuration you requested with ssd or regular hard disk whatever be it you asked for all the networking connections were taken care of it gave you a public ip from where you were able to run couple of commands and then the create server was up you were able to connect from your QEats app to the server you have hosted. Right. If you didn't terminate the instance, it would have been there fine. Right. It would have run for any number of days. All you pay is like maybe say $30 per month. But think of all the hassle, right? You don't have to buy anything. More if you have to upgrade, downgrade, just like that you can do. And if you want to terminate, you all terminated, no charges to you at all. Right. So this resource management, especially for companies kind of whose traffic is cannot be predicted and then they don't want to have special IT admin, etc. is actually a boon. Right. Otherwise, you'll spend half of your time maintaining the servers, putting some people on it, right, doing all the hardware upgrades once in a while. Right. And then making sure that nothing gets stolen. Right. It's all unnecessary hassle that cloud has completely taken out of. Right. Startups just like crazy useful. Now, the next thing is. Advantage of cloud is the multitude of choices, right? Even with software, we have reasonable number of choices. Cloud makes it very, very easy, right? We'll take an example, let's say that you want to choose a storage, right? Some sort of a storage for your project that you are working on in your company. What do you do? You just like go to one of the cloud providers and then search for hey, I want to actually use some storage. What sort of storage options do I have? Where should I store? Should I store it in a DB? Should I store it in some file system? Like, what do I do, right? And then the moment you go there, it's going to throw you a bunch of options. You want fast reads or slow reads, we expect a lot of data to be cached, right? Are you looking for high transactional volume, like a lot of writes in a very short amount of time? Are you looking at large immutable files in the sense like the files are not changing right? Videos, images, right? Are you looking for those kinds of files, right? Are you looking for structured data? unstructured data again they are different structured data means you are kind of like storing I mean we saw the difference between HTTP or data versus the JSON data right the other day HTML versus JSON similarly are you storing structured data unstructured data right do you want to do data analytics on top of this data again based on all these different characteristics of the of your requirement right depending on your requirement the kind of storage that these cloud providers provide is also very like it can also change which means each of these cloud providers they give you kind of like a table right saying okay if you want x plus y go for this if you want this plus this go for this right they'll give you a very nice table and then if you just like go online search for okay I want xyz what is the best cloud storage I could use right immediately you will get some like options compared to say different cloud providers AWS might provide provide you something, Azure might give you something, G cloud might give you something just like compare make a choice right and these choices are kind of like you would not be able to find some of these software like in open source as well right like they are extremely powerful and extremely good at what they do so very very powerful right. Now hopefully that convinces you that first cloud is a real thing right and the advantages are very very real especially for smaller companies startups who want to focus on their product users and not really care about hardware right or the software that are kind of outside of their main work they focus on building things rather than just like getting certain things ready to build the product right very very crucial lot of innovation it just like frees people to do lot of innovation right. Now the next and most important thing of this entire session is how to build a cloud. to learn cloud how do you go about understanding all these buzzwords there are so many buzzwords right lambda serverless computing a blob store like there are like EKS right so how do you go about understanding all these right like your friends let's say they're working on some technology they might just like come and say hey today I use Fargate or I use Cloudrun how do you go about making sense out of all these words right easiest way let's start with one example let's say you are working in quickinfo.com I hope all of you know that they they have this matches streaming one of the very popular sites right and I'm fairly sure all the guys would know right so let's say that they want to build a notification feature I'm sure they have one but like let's say right right now they want to build a notification feature and the feature the thing that the thing that they want to build is for every wicket or a six, okay, they have to send an SMS or at or and a telegram message to all its subscribers. Okay, let's say you go there, say, okay, I want to be notified of every such event, which is like click on notify button, just like YouTube. And then they say, okay, do you want to subscribe to all fours, sixes or wickets, you select the option you configure, and then you are done. Okay. Now, how do you go about choosing the right compute solution for this? Right? What would you have like in your back end to actually achieve this. And remember, there are a few things that you have to keep in mind. Right? So first and foremost, is that matches don't happen all the time. Right? There's a match going on now. But let's say, five days later, there might be no matches at all, which means what will those servers do, right at that point. And second thing, let's say that match happens also, right? It happens for a very short amount of time, if it's a test match maybe the entire day, if it's one day, maybe one day and then two days gap, another another match, right? And if it's 320, it's much, much shorter as well. So there's a lot of idle time. And then suddenly, at some point in time, whenever we get false, or whenever there is a six hit, the user expects that he be notified, like within seconds, right? You cannot actually do a serial way to notify let's say that there is a wicket that falls at nine o'clock, okay, would you be okay, that ESPN comes and tells you after 10 minutes, you will get the notification because I have to send the notification to 3 million users. Not really, right? Every single user will expect ESPN to deliver the notification as if they are the only user, which means the moment a wicket falls, okay, there's no load on the system, all of a sudden, they have to send 3 million messages out. How does that happen? Okay. say you are the developer, you have to make a choice. And you do not know ABCD about cloud. We will see how you can go about it. Generally people go about understanding it from the cloud provider themselves. They give excellent documentation. I am going to click on one of the links. So I am going to search for in AWS, what are the different compute solutions as in what are the ways by which I can use a CPU. Essentially, that is what like processor. So there are different ways of going about it. One is the instance that is like you actually get a server for yourself. Another way is to actually go for something called containers. It is a slightly different technology. You would have heard about the word Docker. Even if not, that is okay. You can think of virtual machine and a container is a very lightweight virtual machine. And then the other technology is called serverless computing. So, they are saying Amazon is saying you, okay, hey, you know what, we have three different kinds of services for you to do any kind of computation in our cloud, okay, now, you go down, and then they will actually give you a lot of options, okay, such as virtual machines, right. And in here, they are saying Amazon ET2, did you guys use it? Secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud, well, if you use this for deploying your QE server, very, very straightforward, all you say is the image, right, whether which version of operating system you want, and then you choose a configuration, some hard disk, some CPU, RAM, whatever you want, that's it, you're getting a server from the AWS, right. So, that is called EC2. And then they have something more, I don't know about some of these stuff as well. So, they say run fault tolerant workloads for 90% of the job. So, most likely, it says EC2 spot instance, so, most likely, they have a cheaper way of running EC2. So in some cases, it might actually work for you, right? That's maybe this is a very useful case for you as well for ESPN creep. I don't know, right? Whatever you want details on, you just like go into that and then do a bit more reading. That's how that's how people learn as well, right? You can't really know, right? Because Amazon is going to launch new like products like every now and then you can't really know all these like Amazon LightSail, Autoscaling, ECS, ECR, EKS, how do you expect somebody to know all these things, right? They will have some basic idea of how to navigate, they'll know few things alone, right? One compute or one or two compute, one or two popular storage services, like one or two popular say messaging service, right? They'll have some every like developer once they get into the cloud world, they'll have some very high level idea of what to look for where, okay? And that includes some of the top or popular solutions available in the market. Once you have that, it's mostly about you reading through documentation. And these people have excellent documentation, they give a lot of use cases to help you understand how to use this, how to use that, when to use this, when to use that, right? A lot of companies, how do how does the other companies use it, right? The moment you have a use case that is very similar to a different company's use case, then you know, okay, this is how Lyft is using it, or this is how Hotstar is using this service. So this is a good match for me, right? And you can see that there are a few things over here, it says containers, they have like Amazon Elastic Container Service, this is Container Service Registry, EKS is Elastic Kubernetes Service, right? And then you have serverless compute for containers. And then one more, this is again serverless containers, or serverless way for you to run code, right? We look at AWS. is Lambda and then EKS and EC2. EC2 is something you already know. Go through high level, maybe compare it with say what Google Cloud provides as well. Maybe Azure provides as well. And then you are coming back. You have read about it and try to understand. They will also probably I will just quickly show you. They might also have some customers talking about why they used what. It's very, very useful. Suddenly you can just like compare, okay, this is what they used it for. Maybe I should just like do the same thing over here as well. They are called use cases or partner use cases. You can actually go and read about it. Now, coming back, you have got a fairly high level idea of what are the options available from Amazon. Now, you feel, okay, you know what, out of all these, these are the three things that might actually work for you. You are just like kind of zeroed in on a few options. So Amazon EC2 is a virtual machine, like whatever you are doing right now. Amazon AWS EC2. lambda is actually a way by which you can run short pieces of code on demand and it will just like go away very very simple okay it's like I want to run say file line of code in Python Java whatever and then that's it you not own a server you just say I want to run these file lines of code run it and then give me the output that's about it right it's called serverless architecture and it's it's a it's very similar to you running a remote function and then getting the output back that's it it doesn't do anything more okay Amazon EKS is slightly more complicated it's the containerization service right so slightly more complicated thing but you feel like okay hey you know what after reading so it's probably not actually fitting your use case now based on the requirements you had that is seasonality of matches sudden spikes and stateless tasks that means that it's not actually doing a lot of DB calls or anything you give it a phone number you give it a name and then say a wicket that's it right there's no other information required you just want to execute some remote procedure called something around that so you go for AWS lambda all right so fairly straightforward right so you go start with some sort of an analysis of what requirement you have go through some of the like documentation that are available on the individual cloud provider service you immediately be exposed to a wide variety of technologies technology solutions they have right then decided on few go the use cases that they have provided decide and then go about implementing which means if you have to implement lambda it might not take more than a day or two like you might feel okay hey you know what this all my friends are saying amazon aws lambda are they actually doing something fancy not really today if you decide before tomorrow morning you can actually get a aws lambda up and running they'd have all the tutorials everything given to you right so that's That's how easy cloud is, okay, to run something, you don't have to go through a lot of pain. Everything is actually pre-configured, all the tutorials are given, they have like very, very clear walkthrough tutorials, right? So it becomes very, very easy for you to pick up any technology on the need basis, right? Now, last story of the day, Achit, one of our cryo advocates who has been helping you throughout this last five, six days, right? He just like this says, okay, you know what, I'm kind of bored, I want to build this quick quick quack app, okay? And that's going to have all the funny gifs and short videos to replace, you know, which one, right? What would you recommend him? What would you recommend? Which storage would you recommend, right? Like he has options with Google Cloud, or he can go for Azure, or he can go for AWS. What would you recommend him ask the storage option to use? How do you go about it? Same thing. Go right today, right? And similarly, like just like I did the compute, you can actually search for cloud storage from AWS, cloud storage from Google, cloud storage from Azure, right? And then you'll find plenty of options. I'm having some options from AWS over here. Amazon S3 says object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Amazon Elastic File System, Scalable Elastic Cloud Native, NFS File System, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Easy-to-Use High-Performance Block Storage, AWS Backup, Centrally Managed Backups and then some Snow Family. I don't know what that means, right? Now, if you have to go about recommending something to Archit, what would that be? All these words, I believe are new to you, right? Go through the documentation and then come up with your requirements, like come up with what you would recommend, right? for his new quick quack service which only has videos and images okay go read online figure out you'll understand immediately if you do it right after the session you'll be able to pick up say five to six words around the storage offered by various various cloud providers and that's how you start getting yourself familiar all right I don't think we can crash AWS right but we can do this let's flood our suggestions to Ashit and DM him right DM him as to what you think is the right storage solution for his use case of his new and innovative effort and then you know just like flood him with your suggestions right try to give the reasoning as well okay all right that's it I hope it gave you a starting point of how to understand cloud that kind of like as long as you have that you just like be all good you just like go about reading things from internet and then finding the right solutions okay so tomorrow as i said we are going to start with the full stack sprint it's going to be a slightly intense session so i would say please block time okay think of it like you're all in the single you're all in a single place and then you are doing it you if you bring that kind of a rigor it will be very very useful for you one more thing this full stack sprint right the reason why we are doing that is you're going to build something on the html using html css a bit of a bit of exposure i would say to the back end right and you'll have an idea what runs on browser what runs on the back end like how are they connected right you'll get an excellent idea of the entire flow okay now why do you need it because in stage two right you have a project right there is a mini project that you have to do in stage two which is most likely going to be a full stack project okay you don't have to be an expert in either but are key goal is that you have the learnability, right? None of us know everything, correct? But you should have the learnability, right? Given some resource, you should be able to learn, apply and then build. That's how almost every engineer works. We don't know every single technology. So tomorrow, please make sure that you participate, don't have any other other commitments. That way you're kind of all set up very well for the stage two project. Okay, you spend good amount of time learn from the byte, just like pick up some of those skill set, understand the entire architecture, the mini project would become slightly more easier for you. Right? And don't don't forget about the session, the big variable session that's going to be from current from tomorrow. That's about it. Have a great weekend. And really happy to see so much of energy out there and continue. Even the slack decorum is amazing. Right? You guys asking in the right channels, help typing each other out I'm saying so many queries and I'm very sure we could be we are a very very small company and I'm very sure without your support we couldn't have been able to resolve so many queries right somebody is asking my Gitpod is not working five people are typing the answer saying you should do this you should do this right so amazing keep the energy going help your peers that's a great way to learn all right thanks a lot and Kiran would be taking over the session tomorrow all right thank you folks bye good night"

I come from different background when I was starting. I don't know what this language do, what this HTML and CSS are for, what is front-end, what is back-end. Coming to Cryo, I was at least knowing the syntax of the basic like JavaScript. I was knowing the working, whatever industry requires, everything I learned there. What I enjoyed most is that everything was structured from front-end to back-end, from DSA. Everything was structured from the very first project. They have taught us how to follow a certain pattern so that the debugging, maintenance of code, everything gets easier. Whatever knowledge or whatever curriculum they had set is quite good. It's a combination of a lot more learning and emotions. Get yourself enrolled into the Cryo and rest they will take care of everything. You"

        "transcription": "Hi everyone welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem print matrix in spiral order we are given an integer a generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 till a square a into a in spiral order so we have to create a matrix a 2d array which will contain the values from 1 till a into a and it should be a square matrix that is number of rows number of columns should be same but the values should be in a spiral order now the spiral order according to the problem statement is a order which will be clockwise in nature starting from 0 comma 0 that is it is starting from the top left corner 0 comma 0 corner and going in the clockwise spiral order so if we take a sample example to get a better understanding for a is equals to 3 the square matrix will be 3 cross 3 and the values will be 1 2 3 8 9 4 7 6 5 these are the values from 1 till a square from 1 till 9 3 into 3 9 in spiral order how is it spiral order we can say if we are starting from 1 then going to 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 then 6 7 8 9 so you can see that it is forming a spiral and it is a clockwise spiral traversal which is starting as you can see from 0 comma 0 cell that is a 1 is at the top left corner so given any n value given any size of the square matrix we have to generate the corresponding values so if I take an example of 4 cross 4 matrix if a value is 4 we can say first it will be having 1 2 3 4 then spiral will go downwards that is it will have 5 6 7 then spiral will go in the left direction that is 8 9 10. then it will go in the upward direction this is how the spiral will be formed so now we will be having 11 12 and same thing will repeat that is 13 14 15 and finally 16 so we can say this is a square matrix which we require for n equal to 4 this is a 4 cross 4 matrix but the point is how we can generate this see if we need a spiral can we say first we need to fill all the values in the top most row that is 1 2 3 4 then we need to fill all the values in the last column that is 4 5 6 7 then we need to fill all the values in the bottom row that is 7 8 9 10 but in reverse order and finally we need to store all the values from bottom to top in the first column that is 10 11 12 but from bottom to top that is in the reverse order and same thing if we repeat for the inner shells also that is this boundary the top boundary we can say the right boundary the bottom boundary and again the left boundary same thing can be repeated and we will be able to print all the values in spiral order we will be able to store all the values in spiral order but the point is how we can run a loop in such kind of boundaries how we can first travel the top boundary so this is let's say the top boundary this is let's say the right boundary that is the rightmost column then this is nothing but the bottom boundary the bottom wall you can say anything and this is nothing but the left boundary from bottom to top so these four walls we need and in order to print these four walls we will require four loops why one loop will be required for this second loop for this third loop for this and fourth loop for this so four loops one for top one for right one for bottom and one finally for the left but given these four loops we need to have some row and column variable pointers why for the top row can we say that the row index will be 0th row r0 r1 r2 r3 similarly there will be column 0 column 1 column 2 column 3 so for the top elements 1 2 3 4 we can say we have to print all the values from r0 with the different columns that is r0 c0 r0 c1 r0 c2 r0 c3 that is 1 2 3 4 we have to store all these values in sequential order so in top wall we can say the row is fixed and the row is nothing but the first row of the entire matrix which is initially 0 for the right wall we are running a loop on the row why because the row is changing from r0 1 2 3 row is changing but what about the column the column is fixed which is nothing but the last column c3 the rightmost cell so we can say the last column is fixed and it is having a value what it is having a value of n minus one why because it is c3 there are four if rows and columns and last column will be four minus one the third column similarly for the bottom wall or the bottom boundary all these values are nothing but having the cells with values seven eight nine ten in the last row that is r3 so last row will be fixed for the bottom wall and which is nothing but n minus one again and the column will be changing but this time in reverse order that is column will be going from three to zero finally for the left wall we will say the column is fixed as the first column so first column is fixed as the zeroth column so we need these four variables first row initially to zero last column initially to n minus one last row initially to n minus one again and first column initially to zero in order to print four different walls but there will be some cases or there will be some issues when we are iterating over the four walls of a given spiral the problem will be if let's say the top wall is getting printed absolutely fine let's say we are able to print 10 1 2 3 4 not just print but we can say we are able to store the values 1 2 3 4 in the topmost row but when going towards the right boundary again 4 will be traveled so we will say that if this cell is already filled this cell is already filled this cell is already filled then we should start from the next cell in the right wall we should not start from the same cell because if we will start from the same cell it will override the value and make it 5 but we don't want to make this value 5 we want the next cell to be 5 so we do not want the corner element to be repeated that is for the right wall we can say the values should start from this particular cell and going to the last row similarly for the bottom wall since 7 is already covered since 7 is already a part of the right boundary we should not start from the same cell we should start from next cell that is if we are taking all these values in bottom wall 8, 9, 10 should get stored as a part of bottom wall and finally for the left wall 11 and 12 should be stored so no value should be repeated no boundary corner case the boundary corner element should be repeated in the top wall this element should not be repeated and how we can ignore this element we can say just discard the top row after printing all the values of the top row after storing all the values of the top row just ignore it and how we can ignore the top row by making the top row or the first row plus plus that is the first row will increment by one after it is stored the last column after it is stored after we are able to store all the values we have to discard the last column so last column will now become c2 c2 means the previous column that is last column should be become minus minus that is decrement by one similarly after printing all the values in the bottom row in all the values in bound bottom boundary we should discard the bottom boundary so that next time it should start from the previous row that is r2 that is row of the last should become minus minus the last row will decrement by one finally for the left wall if we are able to store all the values 11 and 12 now next cell should not get stored in the same column that is now next cell should be stored in the r1, c1 not r0, c0 that is now we can say this column should be discarded and if this column should be discarded we can say first column should become plus plus that is incremented by one so if we talk about entirety what is happening after one shell we are able to discard the top row by making first row plus plus we are able to discard the right wall or the right boundary by making last column minus minus we are able to discard the bottom wall also by making last row minus minus and we are able to discard the left wall by making first column plus plus and this same procedure will repeat now for the inner shell but now this time for inner shell we should basically start from one comma one cell then if there were further inner shells the same thing will repeat so this entire four set of loops for the four boundaries will be wrapped inside another while loop or a for loop which will run for the entire matrix so we have to do the step in a nested loop kind of manner and till when should the outer loop run we can say the outer loop will run till we are able to fill all the values in the entire matrix in a spiral order and when can we say we are able to fill all the values when we are able to basically go till a into a a square because values if a is four are from one to sixteen so the point when we are able to reach to 16 we will say we have to stop so while this loop will run till the point the value which we are filling is not going more than 16 if it is less than a into a so this will be the pseudo code kind of thing let's just write the same thing into the platform so what we need first of all we require a resultant matrix so that we can return it so create a resultant matrix of integers of n rows n columns of n rows and n columns initially all the values will be zero but in order to fill all the values in this spiral matrix we need four pointers what are those four pointers we require top row top column last row last column or first row first column last row last column so we will say initialize initialize top row as zero similarly top column initially was zero the first row first column the last row row or let's not say top row but let's say these are first row and first column similarly last row and last column as n minus one last row n minus one last column as n minus one because it is a square matrix and once we have initialized all these three or four pointers actually we will say run a while loop run a while loop till the point the value which we want to fill is less than or equal to n into n as soon as it becomes more than n square or a square whatever we will stop but value how should we initialize this value variable we will start filling the value from zero comma zero cell with value one we have to start filling one two three four five up till up till n square so initialize val variable as zero or maybe let's initialize at one only so that we can just start filling it from one so we will run a while loop inside this while loop what should we do we should say that we will be running for loops first loop for the top wall so run a while loop or maybe a for loop this time we can run a for loop for the top row for this one two three four values the column will be changing so loop will be on columns from the zeroth column till the third column that is from the first column till the last column so run a for loop for columns in range first column till last one first column until last column and what we need to do we need to just store the value the current value variable in the current matrix so we will say set matrix the current row actually the first row because the current row is the first row comma the current column as value and after setting the value we will also do the value plus plus increment value by one increment value by one why because next cell will be filled by two next cell by three next cell by four and so on so increment value by one this thing which we have done for the top row we have to do it for the left right bottom all that all the four walls all all the four boundaries first boundary is nothing but the top wall let me just write it this is nothing but the top wall next we need the right wall the right boundary so for right boundary how should the loop run for the right boundary that is having values five six seven we need to do what we need to start the loop from r1 go till r3 that is from first row till the last row because first row we should do plus plus so we have to before running the right wall loop to discard the corner element to discard duplicate corner elements to not make this same corner element be a part of the right wall also we have to do first row plus plus so first row should become plus plus then we can say we have to set all the values for right wall that is row loop will run and we have to run it in the range from first row till last row and every time set the last column value the current row comma last column because right wall is there nothing but the last column with the current corresponding value and increment read by one same thing now for right wall after storing all the values in the right wall we have to discard the rightmost cell that is the last corner the last we can say the element having value seven so in order to discard this what we have to do we have to basically make the last column minus minus as it is written as you can see last column should become minus minus after the right wall same thing for the bottom wall but bottom wall should be the inverse or the reverse of top wall top wall was running in the range first column till last column but bottom wall will run the loop for the columns in range last column till first column that is in reverse order from right to left it will run and what to do every time set the corresponding value in the last row not the first row because bottom wall is the last corresponding r3 and similarly if we have to discard this corner element we have to discard the last row by making last row minus minor so last row after printing the bottom wall should become minus minus and same thing for the last wall the three walls are done only the left wall is remaining left wall should also be done in the same manner that is we have to run a loop for the rows this time because for the left wall the rows will be changing from the last row till the first row from the bottom till the top so rows will start from the last row it will go till the first row and what we have to do every time set the corresponding value in the corresponding row comma the first column because left wall is having c0 currently it is having all the values in c0 and as soon as the first column is done we have to discard it by making first column plus plus as written so after running this entire loop we have to do first column plus plus this entire inner four loops will run till the point we are able to store n square values till the point we are able to store 16 values if n is 4 and finally when the entire set the spiral traversal is done we will return the matrix which is formed which we are able to store so return the resultant matrix so this is the entire pseudocode for the problem spiral matrix a little bit difficult problem to be honest but once you will do a dry run using the pseudocode provided to you or using the code which we will be writing in the next particular video the entire code will be or the entire approach actually will be easily clear to you but the point is what is the time complexity and what is the space complexity of this approach since we are running a loop on the entire matrix in some order but we are able to go to each and every cell only once the total time complexity will be equal to total number of cells in the matrix so total time complexity will be equal to order of n into n which is n square that is number of cells what about space complexity if we talk about output space that is a matrix which we are creating since we are creating a matrix of n square n square n square n size that is uh for now 16 cells the output will also be order of n square n but what about extra space since we are not taking any extra space since we have just maintained four variables for integer variables first row last column first uh last row first column and so on what we need we need extra space of constant no extra space constant extra space is required so this is the time and the space complexity for the problem print matrix in spiral order in java programming language we have to first of all create a resultant matrix of integers with n rows n columns that is n square bracket two times because it is a matrix that is a 2d array resultant is equals to new int the number of rows are also n the number of columns are also n because it is a square matrix as it was given in the question now to store all the values we have to create a variable which is val which should start from 1 we will be starting a variable 1 and we will be incrementing this variable as and when we are storing values we have to initialize four pointers that is a four corner row and column values first row initially to 0 then first column initially also as 0 that is a top row top column last row initially as n minus 1 and last column initially also as n minus 1 these four variables once initialized now we can run a loop in order to basically print or store all the values in spiral order so what we need we need first of all inner loop loops for top wall right wall bottom wall left wall so for top wall what we need we need to run a loop for all the columns so for int column will start from the first column it will go till the last column less than equal to last column and column will become plus plus because it is going from first to last so column will become plus plus every time whatever we we are having the value the current first row comma the column value we will store it in the cell so the resultant of the first row comma the current column we will have the value set it as the current value variable and we have to increment the value variable by one so we can increment it by doing value plus plus simply so if I just return the matrix for now we have not implemented the outer loop we have not implemented the other walls for now what should have happen is one two three should get printed in the first row then next two rows should have zero zero zero all all the columns values so let's see if it is having one two three then all three zeros in the remaining two rows yes one two three is getting printed perfectly so now let's now implement the right wall so for the right wall what we should do we should basically run a for loop again but this time for row starting from the first row going till the last row because it will go from top to bottom first row till the last row and row will become plus plus because it is going from top to bottom hence it is increasing and same thing instead of now first row we have to set the value at the first the last column actually that is row gamma last column will be set by val and we will do val plus plus let's run this code again to see if it is working fine for the last wall it should not work fine actually why because first row we have not done plus plus but let's see what is output right now as you can see one two four five six why because this cell is repeated in both the first row as well as the last column it is a corner value so discarding the corner value to be taken twice what we have to do we have to discard the first row all together first row plus plus if we will do it let's see whether it is taking four in the corner or only three in the corner three is the correct output four is the wrong output let's see so it is taking three now one two three then four or five that is the top row the first row is now discarded after it is done we are discarding it same thing we have to do for the last column also last column should become minus minus otherwise it will be repeated for bottom one let's run a loop for all the columns but this time for the bottom one we have to run it in reverse order that is from last column till first column from last column until greater than equal to first column we will run the loop and we will always do minus minus why because we are now going from right to left the last till the first and for the bottom wall the resultant of the current row that is the last row actually because bottom wall is having last row comma the column value we will set it with the current value and same thing we will do well plus plus so if I will run it now again let's see if it is also printing five six seven in reverse order in the bottom wall or not so it is giving me five six seven in the bottom let's now do it for the left one the last one and before that to make the corner element not get repeated we have to do last row minus minus so that after printing bottom one last row is discarded finally for the left one we have to run a loop for the rows but this time from last row till the first row from bottom to top in reverse order that is last row till greater than equal to first row row minus minus because it is going in reverse order and every time set the value at the current row comma the first column because the left wall is nothing but first column as having the current value val and we will also do val++ so if I will run it again let's see if it is giving me 7 8 in the left wall or not it should give me 7 8 in the left one yes but only the outer shell as you can see is printed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 is not printed what will happen for 4 cross 4 matrix it should be able to print all the walls which are in the boundary that is the values we are able to say c is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 all the inner values are not printed why it is happening because this entire thing we have to repeat for all the shells this entire thing is just for one shell one spiral we have to do it for several spirals so before doing for the next spiral we have to discard the first column because we have printed it and now repeat this entire thing in a while till which point till the value which we are storing is less than equal to n square as soon as it becomes more than n square we have to stop because we are then able to store all the values that is all the cells in the matrix so if I will run it again hopefully this time it should give me correct output for n equal to 3 also n equal to 4 also any n variable should give me correct output let's try it for the same sample input 3 it should give me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 in spiral order let's see it is taking some time to run and it is getting accepted let's submit and see if it is working for all the test cases and as you can already see the all 11 test cases are getting accepted but what is the time complexity of this entire approach what is the space complexity of this entire approach first of all if we talk about the time complexity since we are running a loop over all the cells one by one in some order spiral order is there but in some order the total time complexity will be n square because there are total n square cells and the space complexity since we are having a output matrix the output space will be n square but since we are not taking anything extra in order to solve this problem the extra space will be constant just four variables so extra space is constant output space is n square that is the time and space complexity analysis and the corner cases we have already discussed that is we have to discard the values which are present in the matrix corner so that they are not repeated so with that we are done with the problem print matrix in spiral order."

So yeah, like it's been almost two years. So working at Amazon, what is one piece of career advice you would give to upcoming developers? Most I think I feel is deep diving. Like whatever is there, you should deep dive further and try the best and yeah, before reaching out to someone that. So in your tech journey to being a developer at Amazon, what was the biggest hurdle you faced and how did you overcome it? Maybe I think working with a big organization, that was the biggest thing I think. Like when you work with biggest organization, it is completely different compared to what we do at college. It is very different. So you have to adapt to that thing. That's the biggest hurdle I think. You code a lot, right? Yeah.  So what's your favorite snack to have while coding? Coffee. Alright guys.

In this problem, you will have to implement some functions to insert a node at the beginning and at the end of a link list. So there will be two functions as you can see on the right hand side also. Those two functions will be what we have to implement that is insert at beginning, insert at end, insert in the starting of a link list, insert at the ending of a link list. Note that input and output will be handled by main method behind the scenes. We do not have to change it. We do not have to implement the main method or any input output. It means we do not have to take care about input and output. We only and only have to implement these two functions. You have to implement as clearly mentioned, insert at end, insert at beginning functions using the arguments that is the input provided that is what is the data should, which should be inserted and return. the answer based on the return type if there will be so actually as you can see on the right hand side return type is void it means uh we do not have to return anything but that will be clear from the input and output format so what is input format input format is there will be some queries q queries will be there and for each query what is the type of query query one comma three means that we have to insert first query means insert at the beginning and with value three insert a node with value three in the beginning second query means insert at the end but with what value with value six that is data is six so insert six at the end second query means insert at end first query means insert at beginning with value data three so there will be some insert queries only insert at end or beginning depending on queries one or two and output format as you can see is after each query print the link list where each node is printed separated by space although we do not have to print anything in this function because printing will also be handled in the main function it was mentioned input output is already handled I always already handled so we do not have to print anything only and only we have to ensure how to insert at the start or end respectively queries will in total be 20 it means maximum nodes which are going to be inserted in the link list will be 20 only so how actually we can solve it given that you already have a head node and a tail node so link list is you have to implement only that is you will have to maintain these two pointers which is the head pointer and the tail pointer depending on whether we are inserting at or at a tail so let's just do what let's just make initially the head pointer as well as the tail pointer set to what set to null because initially when there will be zero nodes in the link list so both head and tail will be null because right now there is no nodes in the link it means both are null so currently the size is zero and we will be given some queries insert at beginning let's first do a try run for them so let's say we are inserting at beginning with a value maybe let's say with a value 50 I am inserting in the beginning of node with value 50 in order to insert any node with any value what is the first job which we have to do we have to create a node so let's just create a node with value 50 then only you can insert the node with value 50 but what we have to do we have to insert it in the beginning so let me just make it in the right hand side actually in the left hand side how can I insert it in the beginning it should be the part of link list if there will be only one node in the link list because currently there is no node null if it will be the only node in the link list after the insertion of 50 how will the insertion look like how will the link list look like can I say that after the insertion the link list will only have one node with the starting node as well as the ending node at 50 yes surely after 50 getting inserted 50 will actually become the head node node as well as the tail node. Why? Because it is the only node in the link list. So it is the first as well as the last node of the link list. That is the head as well as tail of the link list. And obviously the next of 50 will be null. Next of 50 will be null after 50. There is no new node or next node. So this is a kind of corner case actually. What is a corner case? If the head is null, if we can say the head is null, there is nothing to be inserted. And if head is null, there is nothing to be inserted in the link list or actually we can say link list is empty. This is the first node which is going to be inserted. We can just say simply make the new node become head. That is this 50 will become head as well as null. So this is a corner case. Let me just write this as a simple corner case. Obviously we will write the instruction manual in the cryo website itself. But what will happen in the insertions later on after the first insertion? How will I do second insertion? So let's say we are inserting 40 now at the beginning only. For now we are going to discuss for insert at beginning with value what with value 40 so already link link which is containing one node with value 50 which is nothing but the head node as well as a tail node so let me make two pointers head as well as tail and the new node which is about to be inserted in the front that's why I am making it in the left hand side is 40 so first create the node with data 40 and then how we have to insert it after 40 is being inserted how will the link list look like first node will become 40 because it is the insertion at head insertion at beginning and then next node will be 50 next node will be null because after these two nodes there will be two nodes and the order will be 40 comma 50 because 40 is inserted in the front so if this will be the order what will be the head node after insertion head node will be the 40 node what will be the tail node after insertion tail node will still remain 50 because we are inserting in the front now and now tail is not changing last node is still remaining 50 only only head is changing so how actually I am inserting this particular node in this case corner case we were making head as well as a tail both becoming the new node let the new node is temp but in this case only and only head is going to become temp but actually before making the head become temp if before updating the head and making it go to the temporary node this temporary new node we have to link the nodes also and in order to link the nodes what we have to do we have to actually make the 14 nodes next node become 50 40 dot next will be 50 that is temporary is node the new nodes next should become the current head node so first thing which we have to do is we have to make the temporary nodes next node the new nodes next node become the head node the current head node which is 50 and then make the head node get updated to 40 that is temporary node temp the two steps after the first insertion First insertion was a corner case because it was the first node itself of the linked list. But after the first insertion, every insertion will be following these two steps. Let's just confirm these two steps by adding one more node with value 30. So what we are doing is insert at beginning with value what with value 30 so we already have two nodes in the linked list with the data 40 with the data 50 40s dot next will be 50 50s dot next will be null obviously not data but the address let's say this is 1000 let's say this is 2000 1000 dot next will be 2000 but for now let's assume data is equal to address so this is the head node of the linked list this is the tail node of the linked list and what we are inserting is we are inserting 30 in order to insert any node first create a new node to create a new node with let's say variable pointer temp and in order to insert it after this new node is getting inserted how will the linked list look like 30 inserted a head then 40 then 50 so how to make the link list look like this obviously head will update because head will now be 30 the first node of the link list will tail update no tail will remain same so how we are going to update head obviously head should jump to the temporary node but before making the head jump to the temporary node we have to link the node by making what first step will be by making temporary dot next is equal to head so temp dot next should become head node so these two steps will be required obviously some languages dot operator is not there there will be arrow operator but we can easily like get the syntax or get the knowledge at least that temporaries next node will become head if there is arrow operator you can use arrow if there is any other operator you can use that specific operator also you can use functions also but the syntax will or the logic will remain same only the code will change so let's just actually write the instruction manual first for the insert at beginning then we will also write the instruction manual for insert at end so for insert at beginning first corner case or actually before handling the corner case let's make a new node so make a new node temp with the data as parameter in constructor so with data inserted with data inserted so make a new node temp with data inserted once we have made a new node new list node actually because the node is part of a linked list we have to now check is it the corner case is it the first node getting inserted so if the first node is inserted what will be the head or tail at that point head will be null so if head is null it means this is the first node getting inserted and in that case both head and tail should be set as the new node so set head and tail as the new temp node temporary node but if it is not the corner case then we have to do something else if it is corner case we can just simply return return means do not run the code below it but if it is not the corner case we have to first link the node that is set the temp berries next node temporaries next node as what next node as the head node the current head node as we have already discussed temporaries dot next will be head and make the head go to temp that is set the second step will be set the head as temporary itself order should not be changed we should first link the nodes and then update the head node and no need to do any other changes so that is all tail should not be updated in this part in this case only in corner case tail will be updated so this was insert at the beginning but now let's discuss how we can actually insert at the end the tail of the link list so for that let's just start from empty link list again so now we are actually inserting at tail let's say with values 10 I am inserting at end of the linked list with value 10 and right now we are again starting from empty linked list so that every corner case is also handled we are able to write the sudo code or the instruction manual for corner cases also so initially both head as well as tail will be null we are going to insert the first node so first create that node this time I am writing it on the right hand side why because it will be inserted in the right hand side only tail node that is end node so after inserting it how will the link list look like obviously there will be only one node in the link list with the next pointer null and since there will be only one inclusion one node in the link list after the insertion it will become both the head pointer as well as the tail pointer it means the corner case for the insert at beginning or the insert at end is same which means if head is null or tail is null this means the first node is getting inserted and if first node is being inserted just make that first node become both the head well as still that's it no other change so let's just first copy these three things which is the corner case and making the node is same but if it is not the first node then the changes will be there then we have to insert in the end so for now we are inserting a second node with let's say value insert at and well let's say value 20 so we are inserting a value 20 there is a node data 10 which is being both the head pointer right now as well as a tail pointer right now and we are going to insert a node with value 20 so let's just first point create that node and this name of the new node let's say it is temp how i i am going to insert it after insertion how will the link list look like it will be 10 10s next as 20 20s next as null so as you can clearly see after 20 being inserted in the last can i say it will become the last node of the link list after insertion it means it will be become the tail node of the linked list. Yes, surely. Will head change? No, head will remain 10. Head will remain as it is, but surely tail will change. In this case, the corner case was head is equal to tail is equal to the new node temp node. But in the case, which is not the corner case, which is the second insertion or third insertion or whatever. After the first insertion, tail will get updated too. This is not temp. This is actually tail. This is not temp. Tail will jump to the temporary node. Tail will jump to the temporary node. So tail is equal to temp, surely. But before doing this, this is the second step. You have to again link the node. We have to join them. But this time it is not temp.next is equal to tail. It should be tail.next is equal to temp. Why? 10's next should become 20. 10's next should become 20. So first step should be the current last node of the linked list. The last node of the linked list's next node will be the temporary node, not the head. dot next but tail dot next last node of linked list next node will be temporary node what will happen for the third insertion let's just confirm our two lines of code for third insertion to get a better understanding so insert at the end of the linked list with value 30 so right now assume there are two nodes already in the linked list 10 and 20 10s next will be 20 20s next will be null so this is the head node of the linked list because it is the first node this is the tail node of the linked list tail means the last node and a new node being inserted is value 30 so first create a new node with any name let's say the name is temporary node temp node how to insert it first step should be chaining how to chain since it should be inserted in the last after 10 after 20 30 should be the node so 20 dot next should be 30 it means tail dot next should be temp that's why tail dot next is equals to temp it means we are doing the chaining so tail dot next is equal to temp so we have changed change the link list inserted the new node but tail should also be updated so second step should be the tail will now become the temporary node or you can also say tail will become tail dot next that is also correct because right now tail dot next is temp only so tail will become the temporary node so either you can write tail is equal to temp or you can also write tail is nothing going to be tails next node tail dot next both are correct so this is the instruction insertion at the end so what is the case first make the chaining that is set the tails next node as what as a temporary node as a new node and then make the tail or the update the tail as what tails next node or you get the temporary node again so both the functions are now done the next part of this problem where we will actually write the code so first of all in both the functions we have to make a new node which is about to be inserted how to make a new node in Java I will be using Java for now so we can say listen node temporary I am going to name it as temporary list not a temporary is equal to new list node new means we are creating a new node with new memory allocation and inside the parameters inside the parentheses I will pass the data that is what is the new nodes data initially it should be 0 but I will directly set it with whatever data which we are providing once the node is created this should be the same thing for the second function we will check for the corner case that is whether the node which is about to be inserted is it the first node of the link list as we have discussed in the approach video same here that is if head is null it means right now there is no node in the link list and if there is no node in the link list we have to insert the first node of the link list same here if we are inserting the first node itself the linkage what should we do we should actually make the new node become both the head as well as tail because first node will be with the head as well as tail so head is equals to tail is equals to the temporary node you can write it in two lines that is head is equals to temp tail is equals to temp or you can just write in one line head is equals to tail is equals to temp and return return means do not execute the remaining code because it is a corner case same here for the first node whether it is inserted as a head node whether it is inserted as a tail node it is just the same it is the first node only head as well as tail will both be the same node so let us do what let us run the code and see without the corner case obviously we should be able to at least insert one node of the link list at least first query should be correct that this first insertion should be correct so first query having the data to getting inserted and it is getting inserted properly then forward moving forward obviously the nodes are not inserted properly but let's just do what let's just write the code remaining code so if we are inserting the second node or third node or whatever that is apart from first node we are inserting n is equals to 2 or 3 or 4 at the beginning what should we do we should first do the chaining how to do the chaining temporaries next node should be head temp dot next should be head and when the chaining is done we can also update the head itself because the new node is inserted at the head node head will also get updated as the new node head is equal to temp these are the two steps but these two steps will slightly change if we are inserting at tail which means if we are inserting a tail the tails next will be temp because the new node will be at the end it will be at the tail so current tails next will be the new node so tail dot next will be temp and make that tail go to the next node why because new node will be the new tail node it is the last node now so tail is equal to tail.next set the tail as tails next or you can also say tail is equals to temp because temp is the same as tail.next so now let's just run the code to see if all the cases are actually working or not and if they will work perfectly fine then we will also submit it and we will discuss the time and space complexity yes all the test cases are working even for the corner cases as we have discussed that is for the first insertion itself but what is the time and the space complexity see creating a node is constant amount of time creating node just means create a constructor or call a constructor and create object constant amount of time checking whether head is null constant operation setting the pointers constant operation then again setting the operate basically the next function or you can say setting the next pointer and updating the head is constant so this entire function is constant it means single insertion of a node. a link list at beginning will be constant. Same goes for single insertion at the end of a singly link list given the head and tail pointers will also be constant because all of these operations are constant in nature there is no loop required there is no recursion required so both of these functions are constant for single insertion given that we have head and tail you might have learned about link list where there is no tail pointer but given that we have a tail pointer both the insertions will be constant in nature if there was no tail then a follow problem can be what will the time complexity uh in that case that is if there is no tail pointer provided will the time complexity of insert at beginning change will the time complexity of insert at end change if yes then what will be the new time complexity if not then why not and also what about space since we are creating nodes but it is a part of output it is part of what question is expecting us to do we can't say that we are taking any extra space because we are just using two pointers head and tail pointer so linkless is being created that is what the output is whatever is a part of space complexity is nothing but extra space apart from input apart from output what is extra space nothing just two pointers generally four bytes or eight bytes so constant space for both the function and constant time for single insertion for n insertion it will be linear single insertion constant that is the time and space complexity and there will be surely some follow-ups attached to the same problem linkless insert it might be that you have to insert at a corresponding index of the link list that might be a follow-up or there might be a doubly link list instead of a singly link list that might also be a follow-up so just go through all the follow-ups try to solve them also"

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video, we will be discussing the problem word frequencies. An array of strings will be given to us because words is nothing but strings collection of characters. Your younger brother is really curious to know the frequencies of each word present inside the book. So each word will be present some number of times, maybe one time, maybe two times, maybe more than one times or you can say the frequency of each word is what we have to need to figure out. So we have to do what we have to write a program to calculate the frequencies of each word present in the book in sorted order. So what should be sorted? That is a point. Should we sort the strings that is the words or should I sort the frequencies that we will understand from the problem statement. So what is the input format? The first line of each test case is n that is the number of strings and second. second line of each test case will contain all those strings. So let's say there are five strings in the example, the strings are Aman, Aman, AA, Aman, AA. So these five strings are there in total. So what will be the output? Output will be AA, 2, that is AA string is present two times in the array of words, in the list of words, and the Aman string is present three times, so Aman, 3. In the given output, frequency of AA is 2 and that of Aman is 3. So frequency will be number of occurrences in that given list of words. So if I take one more example, let's take an example having strings Cryo, let's take maybe Aman, let's take Cryo, let's take Cryo again, let's take Aman with capital A, let's take the string where maybe we are having a string or let's not for now capital, let's not take the capital strings, maybe we can have a string, which is Aman again, and let's now take. cryo dot do so these strings are there how many strings are there zero one two three four five in total six strings are there so any six so what will be the frequency of each string as you can clearly see a one in this string is present how many times two times cryo in this string is present how many times three is times and cryo dot do is present how many times we can say one time but what should be the output output should it be sorted on the basis of the strings or should it be sorted on the basis of the value that is the frequencies in the sample input you can say a is smaller than a month two is also smaller than three so it is a confusion actually and the it's this confusion should be cleared by you in an interview by basically clarifying it with the interviewer itself but if you are giving a quoting assessment then what you can do is you can most probably run a sample test case you can just put in a test case and try to run something so For now I am just returning null so that we are not getting any syntax error and what we are trying to do is let's take these six strings which we have taken in the example which are amon, amon two times, cryo, cryo, cryo three times and cryo.do the last time and the expected output if it will be sorted on keys then it will be you can say amon will be first then you can say cryo will be there then cryo.do will be there and if it will be based on the frequency sorting then first cryo.do will be there then amon will be there then cryo will be there let's see what is the order we can confirm it while in an encoding assessment although in an interview as I told you have to clear it with the interviewer himself or herself so it is taking some time to run let's see and the output as you can see is first amon then cryo then cryo.do so it is based on sorting of the strings the words so we have to sort the strings but the point is how we can sort all of these strings this is the output what we need this is the output since we need a list of pairs what will be pair containing a pair will be containing two things first the word itself and second the frequency of that word we need to maintain these pairs we need to store these pairs from the entire list of words so how we can convert the list of words into the corresponding key value pair this is your key this is your value this is your string word this is your value frequency interior frequency so we can actually take help of some data structures which will help me maintain the frequency which will store the key value pair and one such data sector which will help you to store key value pairs will be nothing but a set and actually not a set but a map because map will do what map will store key value pairs but which kind of map in most of the languages there are two kinds of map one is the sorted map one is the unsorted map although it is known in different terms like sorted might be just known as map the unordered map sorted might be known as a tree map unsorted might be known as you can say hash map so it will be having different names but the point is we need a map and since we need all the strings to be sorted since we need all the keys to be sorted one such map which we need is nothing but sorted map we need keys to be sorted and if keys need to be sorted we have to implement the sorted map actually internally what is a sorted map if you will go into internal implementation you can do it as a follow-up to just check through it it will be using a binary search tree a bst tree but for now we can just have a sorted map so what we will do is we will store all the key value pairs in that sorted map initially the sorted map that is the tree map or the ordered map for now will be empty we will be trying to check whether cryo is present in that sorted map till now it is not So I will put cryo with how much frequency old frequency will be zero it is not present till now so it should be taken as zero and new frequency will become zero plus one it is occurring for the first time what about the one same thing since it is not present till now it will become zero plus one and since that remap is sorted we can assume that for now that Aman will be stored before cryo although internally what is happening we can't say for now because internally it is not a linear data structure it is nothing but a hierarchical data structure a tree getting formed but for us we can have an abstraction that the smaller key that is the alphabetical order first Aman will be there because we have a sorted map into place cryo since cryo is already there we will take its old frequency and we will do the frequency plus plus that is now frequency will become one plus one two again frequency will become two plus one which is three Aman frequency will become one plus one which is two and finally the cryo dot do it is a new key which we will insert and the frequency will become 0 plus 1 and once we have all the key value pairs now there is no need to run a loop on the input array we can just return all these pairs by just storing them into the output data type output will be a dynamic list or you can say a vector or maybe a you can say a dynamic array and we will just store all these key value pairs by running a loop on the tree map or the sorted map and just push all these pairs into a vector into a array so that is the approach but what is the time complexity or the space complexity of this approach since first of all if I am assuming that each string is of order of n length where every string if let's say is order of n length and n such strings are there the overall time complexity will go as one single insertion how much amount of time it will take it will take order of n time but  Since it is a sorted map, it will not only take order of n, it will actually take basically comparison, which actually do comparison, so that all the keys are sorted. And if it will do all the comparisons, it will also take order of log n time. So overall time complexity will become how much? Overall time complexity will become n log n for one single insertion. But how many insertions are we doing? We are doing n insertions. So we can say it will become n log n into n again. So it is actually n square log n. That kind of time complexity is l is assumed to be equal to n, it will be n square log n. What about the space complexity? Space complexity we can assume is just all the strings are getting pushed. So if each string is of l length, how many total strings are getting pushed in that sorted map? We can say l plus l plus l in total n into l strings are getting pushed. So space complexity will be l times n. That is each string of l length, how many such strings? instance so l into n extra space due to the sorted map so this is the time and space complexity let's just directly now jump on to the third milestone where we will actually write the instruction manual so what we are going to do is we are going to say let's just create a sorted map let's create a sorted map or you can say a ordered map whatever it is known as in your language which is having of either what of keys as strings because we need to put words and values as integers and let's just say this sorted map is named as the frequency because we are going to anyway store the frequency of all the keys now what we are going to do we are going to run a for each loop on the input array so run up for each loop that is one by one take all the strings from the array of words so run a for each loop on all words of array and just insert them into the frequency so just basically first of all get the old frequency get the old frequency of the string from hash map from the sorted map and we have to actually take default zero that is if the old frequency does not exist then take the default value as zero and what we have to do we have to update the frequency update the frequency of string and the old frequency plus one that is frequency plus plus in hash map or you can say in map not hash map but a normal sorted map so once we have put all the key value pairs in a sorted order all the strings comma their frequencies in the sorted map now we can just form the resultant so create a resultant vector or you can say a dynamic array of pairs dynamic array of pairs and just run for each loop again run for each loop over all key value pairs over key value pairs in hash map just run a loop on all the pairs in HashMap and put all those pairs into the vector. So push each pair in the vector inside the loop which push the pair in the vector and finally we can just return that vector that is what we need as a return type we do not need to return the map itself we have to return the vector that is a dynamic array. So this is the instruction manual which we are going to follow in order to solve this question we will be writing the code for the problem word frequencies now we will be using that pseudocode in order to write the code in java language and also discuss the various corner cases which might be there so first of all what we need we need a sorted map so that we can create all the key value pairs and since all the keys need to be sorted all the strings need to be sorted we have to have a sorted map which is nothing but known as a tree map in java so tree map internally it is nothing but a binary search tree a self-balancing binary search tree but nevertheless map of string comma integer because e will be the words and value will be the frequency of those words that is integer pre-map of frequency is equal to new pre-map this is how you create an empty sorted map in Java and what we can do is we can run a loop on over all the words of the array by a for each loop by running each word at a time that is each string at a time every day and do what with that string first get the old frequency of that string from the pre-map itself from the map itself that is frequency dot get the frequency of this element of this word but if that frequency is not present we have to take it 0 this function will return null if the key is not present we do not want null we want 0 so instead of using get function we can use get or default function that is if the word is present take the frequency of that word from map but if the word is not present in the map take the frequency of 0 that is a second parameter and now you have to do frequency plus plus now what we can do is just put the frequency put means update here put will act as update where we will just say that for the same word put the frequency as the old frequency plus one if it is being inserted for the first time it will get zero plus one as one frequency for the first time frequency will be one but for the second time onwards whatever the old frequency will be just add one in that and update the frequency so this is how we can create the entire tree map let's just print the tree map in order to ensure that we are getting the same you can say all the keys or not all the key along with their values or not and for now what we are going to do is we are going to just return null so that we are not getting any uh missing return statement error so let's see what is the output it is taking some time to run let's see and the output as you can see is a month two cryo three cryo dot do one and all the key value pairs are sorted as you can clearly see so that remap is working absolutely fine what we can do is we can create a resultant vector which is containing the dynamic array of pairs the dynamic array of pairs it will store so let's create a vector that is what we have to return in this return type vector of type pair it will store the key along with the value the string along in the integer and let's say this is resultant is equal to new vector and how we can push all the vectors from hash map or maybe the tree map the sorted map that is into the vector we can run a loop on this sorted map so it will run on all the key value pairs but how to run a loop on all the key value layers from a hash number from a map we can just say that take one entry from a map entry will be a key value pair so how to run or how to sorry how to take a data type which is entry that is which is nothing but a value pair we can say map from the map take an entry of type what of type string comma integer every entry is having two things first data type is string that is a key second data type is integer let's say this is pair which we are getting take all the pairs one by one from the frequency map and we can't run a loop directly on frequency we have to say we are running a loop on the entry set we are running a loop on all the entries entries will be all the pair how can you get the key from the entry how can you get the value from the entry key is nothing but string so string key is nothing but the pair dot get key get key will be the function to get the key from the bear and similarly how can you get the value from the pair you can say pair dot get value simple enough so this is how you are running a loop on all the key value pairs let's just for now print all the key value pairs so that we are ensured that whatever we are trying to do is it working fine or not i am using print tell in statements so that all the outputs will be in the different lines all the key value pairs let's see what will be the output for this loop it is taking some time to run I don't know why it did not run completely let's run it again so let's wait for the output actually let's do what let's just use print statement I am not sure why it is not running it might be again a portal issue again so let's copy this entire code and refresh the portal so after refreshing the portal if I will run the code again let's see if the output is getting displayed or not okay so there is a small spelling mistake we are using string it is not string in value it is integer in value or you can use integer with capital I both are equivalent only so value will be an integer the frequency let's just run it again to see and output as you can see is only one string was there in the custom test case. Let's try our own test case where there is Aman, Aman, Cryo, Cryo, Cryo, Cryo.do. Let's run this code. Hopefully, it should give me all the key value pairs. Only three outputs should be there because three different strings are there. As you can see Aman2, Cryo3, Cryo.do1. Yes. So this loop is working fine, but we have to push all these pairs into the vector into the resultant. So we can do resultant.add a new pair, a new pair because resultant is containing pairs where I am calling this function, this constructor pair, and I am passing the key and the value. So what is the key? Key is the string. And what is the value? Value is the integer. So push all these pairs. And now instead of returning null, we will return this resultant vector only. So let's just see if it is working fine or not now. Let me just have this comment line before. the pushing thing let's see if the resultant is also same as what we require like the map was correct the loop was correct but are we able to transfer that all key value pairs into the list and yes we are able to so if we will submit this code let's see all the test cases will work or not and as you can see 22 test cases are getting accepted all the test cases are getting accepted so all the corner cases are working the sorted nature is working and what was the time complexity and space complexity time complexity was running a loop on all the strings order of n but get or put will be having for each get or put it will be logarithmic of n into length of the string so overall time complexity for this entire code will be n into l into log of n that is you can say it is n square log n in general and what about the space since we are using an extra map it is not in the input not in the output so due to this map there are the space complexity complexities of all the strings getting stored and how many strings are getting stored n strings of each ln so total space will be n into l again so that was the time and space complexity for the problem word frequency."

        "transcription": "I was a mechanical graduate, completely out of the interest for coding pulled me through Crayo. I've seen a lot of, you know, boot camps and stuff. Learn by doing stuff was completely new because I've never seen a platform like that where you have some micro experiences. Through Crayo, I mean, you get a sneak peek of what happens like in the real world. You get a hands-on experience, what to do, what not to do, how to do. I need to have some proper curriculum or a daily regime to get this knowledge. I practice myself to write clean code, good code, which is readable, also maintainable. That mentality, by doing week in, week out, daily, writing code, writing stuff, breaking code, that's what I really aim for. Main thing you need is a mentor. Second would be your aim and third thing would be your zeal to learn. I mean, the mentor part and all the things Crayo will take care of. This is more than enough to get started. It's a sneak peek into what you really want to do. This enhanced. experience of doing things, breaking, building some projects, you know, this builds a lot of confidence. That builds a solid understanding of what goes into proper production. Everything is a tool. You just need to know the right tools at the right time to build quality stuff. This is an innovative and pioneering thing they're doing and I'm really satisfied coming here and having this experience. I'm really happy. Thank you. "

        "transcription": "Hey, this is Dathina, co-founder at Career.Guru. This is Career Caf\u00e9. Let us look at today's question, let me pick one and directly dive in. Oh, this is most commonly asked question, we get it all the time. The question is can I, when I want to do a career transition, can I self-study or do I need to take help from a platform like Payo and WhyTrade? I answer this in two parts, let me start with WhyTrade, because this is a question we need to answer ourselves even five years back, we have so many learning platforms out there, why do we need to start one more learning platform, that's the first question all of us have to answer ourselves even starting with Payo. If you just look at it, I think learning material is never over or the mediates have changed and Udacity and all of it, then you have a lot of platforms providing live lectures. Even though the medium of learning has changed over a bit of the last decade, how people learn have not changed, right? And you want to start great, the only purpose we had was, can we have a platform that somebody can learn these blackboards practically the way they learn at work? All of us have joined work, right? And we have learned a lot of things while at work, right? Why can't learning be the way we learn at work, right? I think that is a core purpose within Cryo. Cryo's pedagogy actually represent that, right? And we are very, very happy to say that we are one of the first platforms to provide work-related experiential learning. This makes anyone to learn any skill in the most practical way, right? So we believe we kind of stand out in providing an amazing learning pedagogy where someone can learn the skill to the extent they can apply it and build something in their skill set, right? With a lot of learning material out there in the market, right? YouTube is a great learning platform where you can learn about. you can get basic exposure, no doubt about it, right? But can you learn to the extent and then apply the question? I think that's where you'll be able to stand out well. Second part, do you need a learning platform, do you need a learning partner, like Fido to look at your answers, right? There, let's look at, you have a lot of learning content out there. When YouTube is amazing, you have all the content out there in the world from great experts. If you go to UWE, you get something for 900 rupees, something for a thousand rupees. You have all these kinds of learning content out there, right? It's all this learning content being available can make people experts. Now, all of us should have been experts in almost everything, right? Having a learning content out there, having a book in my shelf does not make me an expert, right? Having access to learning content does not make me an expert. What we realized in the last four years of helping thousands of people, learning is a process which requires an entire certain ecosystem. Who is the person? Who is the expert? Who is PG? What is their background? Will you listen to them? Are they going to be unique perspective? What is the learning pedagogy the platform brings in? And what are the kind of support system the platform brings in? For example, a career, from morning to evening, you have to be asked at which time somebody responds within five minutes. It may sound very simple. But one day, they respond in 30 minutes. You learn in four breaks. And you have mentors who will actually guide you with respect to career. And you have a team that is working to bring opportunities from a lot of companies for you to interview for. All this entire ecosystem makes the learning path very easy for you. We're very, very proud to say that giving you a proven path to success, you're almost 80% there. There are a lot of things for us to improve. But definitely, we very confidently say, once you come in, you put the effort, you're 80% confident you have a proven path to success. A lot of times, what people don't realize is you stop at the money you spend. Just allow money. Just want to spend nine minutes of time, 12 minutes of time. You very well won't spend the blaze. where the path to success is proven, right? You can't experiment, right? You can't experiment nine minutes something. You probably need to take a book and read, right? I'm not here to deny that. You can't actually get a job and you can't make a great transition just by getting three books and reading it full time. The question is, can you do it, right? The difference here is we have a proven path which we're improving day by day to success. There's a whole lot of people working to make you succeed, right? Coming back, can I do self-study? You can, of course, do, right? But you want to experiment, you want to spend time, or you want to go through a proven path. You want to work with the company who's actually in the path, the way to actually figuring out a proven path, improving day by day. Second tip, what is the pedagogue? You want to just learn concepts to reproduce or do you want to learn the concepts to the extent you can apply in the build, right? I believe going to Blackcomb and Crayo is going to give you a proven path for success. Second, going to Crayo will give you the most practical way to learn skills. right and that's how we believe Creo can be an amazing partner for you to go through the career transformation journey hence I see. Thank you."

So we have three winners of this category. The first winner is Nandini Chauhan. So Nandini is one of the most inspiring person we have come across in Cryo. Coming from humble backgrounds, she is the first in her family to hold a corporate job. We're extremely inspired by the career trajectory she had in the year 2023. And congratulations, Nandini, truly, truly deserved. All right, the next winner for the inspiring beaver of the year award is Subhroto Chakraborty. So Subhroto never got a graduate degree, but he did crack a full stack down of a role at Revivo Tech. He really did prove that a degree won't get you anywhere. All it takes is a little bit of hard work. the right skills and you really proved it so congratulations and the final winner in this category is Shubdiv Das. Shubdiv was discouraged when he had a lot of backlogs in his college and he could not sit for placements but he took things into his own hands and decided to upskill with cryo along with the last year of his college so guess what when he graduated from college and cryo at the same time and he got placed along with his peers in college how cool is that extremely happy for you Shubdiv actually Shubdiv is here with us Shubdiv would you like to say a couple of words yeah thank you so much for this honor of giving me this award and yeah it's like I would like to share my journey so yeah when I was in college due to backlogs I couldn't really sit for my placements and during that time I wasn't even into coding I wasn't even doing my academics properly and at that time when I saw cryo and the career opportunity opportunities that they were offering. I was like, let's give them a try. I couldn't be more happier with that because it's not even like I got a job. I learned some things I learned like how to learn things. That's a major thing that I learned like now when I'm doing my job, I'm not scared to like if something new comes up or anything. It's like I know how to learn things. I know how to manage myself and do things accordingly. And yeah, I would like to just say thank you to the whole cryo team, especially the customer success team, the tutors, the TAs, everyone for doing such an amazing job and making this such a thorough process for everyone. Thank you so much, guys. Thank you, Shubdia. What an amazing space. Thank you very much and congratulations and welcome to Cryo Hall of Fame."

        "transcription": "Hi, I'm Pragya Kushwaha. I work as a UI developer at SpiceJet. I come from Lucknow. As a child, I have always been ambitious. Since childhood, I had several aspirations and the most prominent was to become a scientist and that's how I ended up being in Biotech. Education to me is not about scoring marks. To me, it is like come across the topic, go through it, understand the concept, what it is actually talking about, what it's really trying to teach you and how you can put that into a real world. So that was how I used to learn things but this didn't work well with Biotech because in Biotech, everything was new and it was more of theoretical. I have to memorize a lot of stuff. I wanted to quit and I shared this thing with my parents but they were not thrilled about it. So I understand where it's coming from but without doing much thinking into that, I decided to continue with the subject. It was during COVID that I had extra time to reflect on how the things are going on with my life. And I also wanted to explore things which are not part of my daily routine. And coding was something that came to my mind in the first place. I ended up finding free learning materials over the internet. I was reminded of my days in 11th and 12th grade, where I enjoyed solving these coding problems. And that's how everything started. And I found that web development would be the right choice for me to go ahead with the transition from biotech to CS or IT field. So I was looking for a platform that could offer me with right set of information, and keep me in power with the candidates who have already earned bachelor's degree in computer science. Secondly, I was looking for a platform that would offer me right placement opportunities. So I found that Cryo has all these, and also it's one of the few platforms that offer transitioning opportunities, whether they are coming from biotech, arts, physics, so background is not a barrier here. Technologies or the languages that are being taught to us, it starts from the zero level, the beginner's level to the advanced level. At any point if you feel stuck, I was provided with live Q&A sessions and other one-to-one sessions where you can raise queries, ask for questions, and they're there to help you out. So I did try all of those, and there were moments where I was stuck, there were moments where I felt that I won't be able to make it. During those times, I have remembered the line said by Ejo Sir during the class, he once said that never doubt yourself depending on your background, never think that you cannot compete with people who already had bachelor's degree in CS, you're as capable as them, so just work hard. and make sure that you're up-skilling yourself and the rest will be taken care of. So, Cryo has an entire one sprint dedicated to interviews. So, in that sprint, you're given more than enough information that's required about preparing yourself for the interviews. Cryo curriculum also has mock interviews, which will help you identify your weak areas or the concepts that you do not have a clear idea of. So, that mock interview also helped me in getting myself ready for the interviews, opportunities that are on the way. Honestly, I was very happy when I got selected into SpiceJet. And it was my hard work, the nine months of journey with Cryo, the DSA prep, mock interviews, live Q&A sessions, everything paid off. And I was happy to see how my journey... goes from here. I want to thank Cryo for everything that they do for their learners. To the future developers of Cryo, I would say never give up on yourself and never give up on your dream as well. There will be moments you will feel overwhelmed so just take a pause. You shouldn't get into that spiral zone or shouldn't yield to the negativities. Just keep that piece of advice in your mind. Rest. With regard to concept, ask as many questions as possible. Even if you feel that your questions are dumb, go ahead and ask. Because your mentor is always there to help you. My aim currently is to learn as a fresher as much as possible from people around. In the next five years I would see myself being a rockstar developer."

It gives you an entire catalogue of the white sneakers available at the moment. But where does it store such a large amount of data and gives you exactly what you're looking for? Well, that's where MongoDB comes into the picture. It's like an organized storage room at the back end of your marketplace. In this case, it's Ebay. So whenever a user leaves a review or there is a new product launch, that MongoDB in its database stores all this data neatly and keep it organized in the back end. So when you search for something like white Nike sneakers on Ebay, then all the items that are matching the search term are fetched from MongoDB database and they appear on your screen.

So I was not getting the course or anywhere else as well. So that's, that's the way I have landed into cryo. Coming to the learning journey, I have learned a lot of things. So my programming and coding skills has improved a lot. My problem solving skills has improved a lot. And also my communication and way of thinking has also changed a lot. The mentors are very helpful and the teaching is very good. The industry level people are teaching with their experience, right? So it is very much helpful for the students. Whenever there's a problem statement is given, before I used to just go ahead and. solve the problem without having the knowledge. After joining Cryo, I have followed the curated lecture. Then I have been able to understand the problem and clearly and break down the problem and then able to solve the problem. Yes, exactly. So Cryo has provided projects.

        "transcription": "In this video, we are going to learn about a coding editor which is known as REPL.IT. So REPL.IT is a coding editor where we will be executing our JavaScript files, we will be creating our new files, we will also be creating our folders, we will be managing all our JavaScript files over there and we will also learn about how do we execute our own created JavaScript files on REPL.IT. So REPL.IT allows us to write some code on the browser. The link for that is given over here which is REPLIT.com. So let us visit this website and create a new account for us in order to execute our JavaScript files. So if you visit REPLIT.com, this is the kind of the screen that you will be able to see. Now you have to click on sign up after which you need to click on continue with Google. Now you can use the same account with. which you have registered on cryo as well. So I'm also going ahead with the same account. Once that is done, you will be redirected to this kind of a screen after which you need to click on this button, create rebel. So I'll be clicking on create rebel after which this is the screen you will be able to see. Now in the template, you need to search for an option known as node.js. So as you can see, a template is available over here known as node.js. So you have to select that. And then you have to give the title for your rebel. So let me just give it as cryo foundations, JavaScript. Okay, and then you can click on create rebel. Once you click on create rebel, it will take some seconds depending on your network and after which you will be able to see this kind of a screen, there will be an empty index.js file over here. This is the place where you will start writing your code and on the right side is the place where you will be able to see all the output of the executed JavaScript files. Okay, so how do we make new files now and how do we print something on the output to check whether this replete is working for us or not? So how do we print hello world on the output in JavaScript? So for printing any such thing on an output in JavaScript, you use the command console.log. Okay, console.log is going to help us print something on the output. Okay, so let me go back to replete and let me just say console, let me just write over here console.log hello world. Now how do I run this file? You can see a button over here known as run. If I click on that, you can see hello world got printed over here. So there was a javascript file in which I said console.log of hello world and once I click on run, the same thing got outputted on the console as well. So this is how you make use of replit in order to execute your javascript file. But wait, this was a default file that replit gave us. Can we make our own files? Yes, we can. Can we execute our own files? Yes, we can. Let us also try to understand how we can make our own javascript files on replit. So where do we add the code and how do we run the code in a file using the node command? Let us try to understand that now. Going back to the replit, you have some options on the left side, which is known as new file and another one is new folder. So let us first of all create a new folder for our learnings over where we will maintain all of our javascript files. of all the codes that we are going to execute. So if I click on this icon, New Folder, I'll name it as Learning REPL. You can click on Enter and the folder would be created, inside which you will be getting an option of adding another file or a folder. So I'll be clicking on this file over here and I will say Learn REPL.js. You can name your file anything as per your convenience, but this is what I'm naming for myself. Now this is an empty JavaScript file that you have created for yourself. You can see the whole file is empty currently. Now over here also I could have said console.log of Hello World. Or let me just print something different over here. Let me just say Hello World in Repl.it. If I now click on Run, you can still see it is running. still printing hello world only. But why? The reason behind that is this run button is configured to only run the index.js file. If you want to run the file learn-repl.js, you have to write a command on the shell. Now where do we access the shell? You have an option of shell over here. If the shell is not visible for you, you can click on the plus icon, scroll down and you can select the shell from here as well. This will also help you open the shell. Now you have to write a command in the shell to execute this file. And what is that command? You have to write node space, the path of the file. How do you find the path of this learn-repl.js? You can simply right click on that file and click on copy file path. Once you come to shell, you can simply paste it over here. So I'll just say paste. So node space, the folder name slash the file name. If I click on enter, you can see hello world in replete. So this is how I can create my own file inside a new folder and to execute that file. I can use the node command, node space, the path of the file. Once I click on enter, this is the output that you can see on your screen, right, perfect. So where is the output displayed? You just saw that you can see it right below the command that you have executed. Hello world in replete. How to create a new file or folder? Let's do this once more so that you're absolutely comfortable about it. So let me just make another folder. I'll say it as learn JS. In learn JS, let me just create one more file. Maybe JS is amazing, .js, right? Now over here, I can print something else as well, console.log of... cryo.do is the best place to learn. Best place, right? Now, if I want to execute this file again on the shell, I simply have to say node space the path of this file. So I'll say node space, I'll right click, I'll click on copy file path and I'll just paste it over here. I'll click on enter. You can see cryo.do is the best place to learn. And this is how you execute your own files in repellent. Okay, so these are the things we wanted to cover. You are going to solve an activity, you're going to write your very first program on repellent. So you have to create a new file with the name, print your name.js, in which you have to console.log your own name. Now this activity is going to help you get comfortable with console log statements and how do we print something on the output of the console. So pause this video now and please try to solve it on your own once. Alright, so by now, if you have already paused and solved it, that's great. If you're facing any issues, let's see how do we actually solve this activity. So let's go back to repl.it first of all. And for my activities, I'll be just creating a new folder. So what I'll just do is I'll make a new folder as activities in which I will say activity1.js. Now in activity1.js, you simply have to do a console.log of whatever your name is. I'm simply going to print cryo.do. How do we execute this file? You simply have to use the node command. So node space, you can copy your file path from here, just paste it here and then you can see it is going to print cryo.do and respectively your own name as well. So this is how you can always print something on the output of the console. You"

        "transcription": "Hi, I'm Karthik Bajaj. I was born in Haryana and I'm currently working as a senior software engineer in Adobe. So the first time I was introduced to a computer, it was a plain desktop, the one basically that you assemble kind of thing. It's a very, very generic model. I was open to so many possibilities that are present that you can do so much things from a computer itself. And that's when I thought that this is somewhere I would like to go. So when you get right out of college, it's a completely different thing. Whatever you have started in those four years, it's a very, very little part that's been used in the, you know, real life jobs. And my first job was a professional services consultant. It's a semi-tech job where you weren't exactly coding or doing development. I didn't want to end up in a stagnant job. I didn't want to be there in every four or five years. I'm going to do the same stuff and I asked myself that will I Be happy doing this in the next five years or next ten years down the line and the answer was a definite no It was a kind of 180-degree switch from Non-tech to completely tech sector. So I looked into some tutorials online in online It's basically ten hundred dots spread across but you don't know how to connect them You lack a particular mentor. She will lag a particular path. I had a talk with the co-founder Sridhar as well He recommended the back-end track I thought let's go with it because he's obviously the person who's familiar with that field is guiding so many students So then I enrolled into the cryo back-end development program So it was all project-based learning or learn by doing learning there. I got introduced to Concepts not just that but competitive coding not just doing three questions of C++ or Java on a platform but rather doing project-wise, it's not just coding that, but a step-by-step approach of how to make it better as well. You know, there's no technology company that strives on just being stagnant. It keeps on involving, keeps on involving on the problems that they face, on the scalability that is an issue. It's always an evolving sector and that's how the project was also there, evolving on the needs. One more thing about the programs for us that the peer groups we were in, so the classes were not one-on-one, but they were live sessions with a batch of 20-30 people across, very strong point to have a good peer group. You bounce ideas off them, you bounce solutions off them. I remember teachers, they are basically my age, what, 22-24 or something, working as an SD 2-3 in a good reputed firm. It's quite inspirational to see people of our age guiding people. That kind of helped out and here I am as well. So after you are done with all the data structures and projects. Once we finally have the interview preparation, they scan through your resume, scan through your online profiles, help you perfect them and help you with the interview process as well. Conduct mock interviews and that also with the peer groups, with the mentors so you know your strengths and weaknesses and you can work upon it. There were interviews lined up for Zivame as well and we also had a cryo alumni in that particular company. Network or a person to contact to know that how good is this company and how will it enhance your growth. The rounds completed, the HR round went well and I got a nearly 50-60% hike. After nearly 6 months in Zivame, I had an opportunity to interview with Adobe. I thought it's like a once in a lifetime kind of thing, a company is reaching out so let's go ahead with it. So I told them about the projects I did in Cryo as well, the projects I did in Zivame. The interviews went well and I cleared that as well. I got a 300% approximately hike. It's been great because right now if I ask myself the same questions, will I want to be in the same sector in the next five years, then the answer is now happily a yes. So I've been in Adobe for last six months. I look forward to working every day because I get to work on something that I'm actually happy about. I'm constantly developing, constantly innovating. That's what technology should be about making real impact on people's life."

You'd be surprised, but it takes only six to eight seconds to decide whether you are a good fit for the interview rounds. Here's another question. 70% of the time, who sees your resume first? The hiring manager, the recruiter, the ATS? The correct answer is ATS. ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System. It is a software used by companies to track and manage their job applicants. ATS goes through the resume content and picks the resumes that have relevant keywords to match the job requirements. That's right, 70% of the time, your resume is being scanned by a machine even before it gets into the hands of a human recruiter.

Hi, I'm Hrithvik, and today I'm going to walk you through actionable tips and insights to build a solid one-page resume. \u266a The only way you can grab a recruiter's attention is by presenting your work in the best way possible. And give them a reason to call you and further discuss your work in interview rounds. As a software developer, your resume should showcase your technical skills, projects you have worked on using those skills, and details about the languages, technology, and tools you know. The information has to be crisp and functional rather than beautiful. Ready to learn how you can create a crisp and functional resume for yourself? Like the video to let us know. To make it easier for you to follow, I'm breaking down the process into six steps. Stick around till the end and we will be looking at each step in detail one by one. Step 1. Prepare a rough draft. Before you begin creating your resume, go through the guidelines given in the resume guide attached in the description box. Once you have done that, start preparing a rough draft of your resume. Don't worry if your draft is longer than one page. The later part of the video will help you crispen your content. The process of creating your first draft might take at least 6 to 10 hours, stretching over multiple days. So let's look at what goes into your first draft. Optional part would be objective and summary. You need some personal information, skills, projects, work experience and internship, education. And another optional part would be achievements. extracurriculars. Let's break down each of these sections one by one. Unless you have over five years of experience, this section is not particularly useful. I'm a hard-working person with vociferous appetite for learning and I'm willing to die for the organization. Most recruiters have seen professional summaries on these lines and honestly it does seem pointless. There's one exception though. If you're moving from one role to another, this section becomes extremely relevant. It helps the hiring manager understand what you have done in the past and what you want to do next. So add your intent in this section which can actually be useful. I'm a QA professional with two years of experience. I've completed my fellowship in full stack from cryo.do and I'm ready to move to a development role. This emphasizes both what you want to become and what you have actually done to get there. If you are including this in your resume, be sure that it is to the point and clearly states your career objectives. Coming to one of the must-have sections, something you absolutely cannot afford to miss, that is your personal information. It has to be present at the very top of your resume. Let's say a recruiter is impressed with your work and wants to get in touch with you but if they don't know who you are and how to reach you, they would just drop your resume and move on to the next one. Be sure to include your name, phone number, email, github handle and linkedin handle. It's optional to add your photo in your resume. It's a personal choice and I'm quite neutral about it. This much information is all recruiters look for. Anything beyond that like your date of birth, marital status, gender, parent's name, home address are irrelevant. Recruiters just skip this part as it has nothing to do with what they are looking for in a candidate. What they're looking for the most is your skills. Since this is one of the most important sections of your resume, we'll go over in detail during step 3 part of the video and learn how to craft this section in a way that will impress recruiters. To back up your skills, hiring manager look for relevant projects that you have included in your resume. The basic rule of thumb is to include projects where you have written at least 100 to 150 lines of meaningful code. If you really want to grab attention, don't include projects like student attendance system, library management, twitter sentiment analysis or some random iot ones. Given that 99% of the people who have these in their resumes have hardly written any code. Hiring managers comfortably ignore these. Fun fact, 90% of the students today have social sentiment analysis project in their resumes. Another mistake many people make that gets their resume rejected. is by adding too many non-development projects when applying for a software role. For example, three to four ML projects on your resume when applying for a developer position is not going to get you shortlisted for the role. So might as well take that out of your resume and include relevant projects that match the company's expectations. If you want to stand out, but you're not sure what projects to work on, check out Cryos Project Hub. Here you'll find 50 plus projects in Python, web development, Java, and more. The best part is that they come with a free guided plan to help you finish the project all by yourself. In addition to your projects, hiring managers look at your work experience to assess how hands-on you are with your technical skills. They're going to scan through the work you have done, the impact you have created, and for how long have you worked in the respective companies. So be sure to include your role, company name, duration, responsibilities, and the tech you worked on. When you're writing about your responsibilities, be sure to remove sentences that are too generic and don't directly reflect your contribution. And also, don't copy paste bullets from a job description. Consider a work experience section like this one. Do you see anything wrong? Resolving tickets, maintaining issues. logs, understanding project requirements, analyzing data, etc. are all too generic and don't communicate your contributions in a clear manner. Now look at this job description. Aren't the responsibilities written in the resume the same as this job description? But instead, if you write the same thing as solve 300 tickets with an average feedback rating of 4 out of 5 for an insurance client, it clearly shows the impact of your contributions. If you want more tips on how to craft these sentences, go through the tips and guidelines given in the resume guide shared in the description box. Next comes your education background. Keep it simple and cover all the info in about 3-4 lines. Your class or degree, college or school name, and year of passing. If you scored well across 10th, 12th, and graduation, include all three. These communicate that you're a studious, which is a useful attribute. Add these in reverse chronological order. That is, show your graduation details first, followed by class 12th, and then followed by class 10th. After 4 or 5 years of experience, there's no need to add 10th or 12th marks unless it could be a highlight in your resume. It is not necessary to add all the subjects you took up in college. They don't add value to your resume. The final step to finishing up your draft would be to include some achievements or extracurricular activities that show your soft skills. It is not compulsory to have this section in your resume, but if you won prizes in coding competitions or you play a sport representing your school or any other level, it helps to communicate your soft skills like perseverance, discipline, team player, and so on, based on what you include. With that, you should have your initial draft ready. If you are struggling to remember your work contributions and fit them all in your resume, here are three pro tips for you. Pro tip one, take the task of jotting down all the things you have done well in the past that are relevant to the type of job you're applying for. Once you have dumped all the details, start trimming it down and move things around to fit relevant information in a structured way. You'll realize that it's easier to cut down on things rather than think about how to add new content. Pro tip two, whatever notes you have jotted down about your work experience, retain them. They will come in handy when you have to quickly refresh what you have done in the past before an interview. Pro tip three, you may not remember all the things you have done over a period of time, so go through your performance reviews in the company for a list of all the work you have done in the past. Now that you have your first draft ready, let's dive deeper into how you can present your work experience in the best way possible. Look at these two examples. The first one is quite generic and doesn't communicate the impact of your work. Look at the second one. By including numbers and adding specific details, you can objectively showcase how your contribution helped the organization. Here is a simple and effective structure that you can use. And to fill in your action, use powerful verbs like accelerated, built, increased, etc. to describe your contribution in a meaningful way. For example, develop a caching system using Redis to improve the application's performance by 20%. At the end of the day, you're an engineer. Your skills count more than your creativity. My recommendation would be to make this section as functional as possible in your resume. Here's how you can do it. Organize your skills into various categories. Separate out languages, technologies, tools, etc. and mention what you know in each category. Avoid using buzzwords that you can't justify in your resume. In other words, if the interviewer asks about various words in your resume, can you answer them clearly? If no, then drop them. Remember that your resume is the best representation of your work that you can defend in an interview. For example, if you have added Docker or Kafka to your resume and the interviewer asks you a question about them, if you're unable to answer, it leaves a bad impression. Third important factor is position. That is where you place your skill section. At a glance, anyone should be able to find the skills section and get a sense of what you're good at. I would recommend having it close to the top section of the resume right below your profile info. Remember we discussed about ATS? Optimize this section for it. If you go too graphic here, ATS may find it hard to pass the information and this would result in lower chances of a human seeing your resume. Now that you have included all important sections in your resume, it is time to fine-tune and structure it into a one-page resume. Given that there are multiple sections in your resume, what do you think should be the first section of your resume? Is it how do you go about ordering the following? Education, qualifications, work experience or projects? It is important to note here that sticking to any one template may not always do you good. Every person is unique and can adopt different ways to highlight their best skills and strengths on the resume. Let's say you're from one of the NITs or IITs. This aspect alone can get you shortlisted in multiple companies. So unless your current company gives you much more leverage than this, bring this to the top. If you have work experience close to the job you're applying for, consider adding this as your first section after personal details. If you're making a career switch, for example you're moving from a QA role to a developer role, your work experience might not be of much help. So add personal projects to the top with quite a bit of detail about the tech and skills you use. This will give you a better shot at getting shortlisted. If you're not sure which section to add at the top, you can use the paper sliding technique. Cover your entire resume with another piece of paper and slide it down section by section. This is how a recruiter sees your resume. Suppose your recruiter stops seeing your resume at 1 fourth of the page, what would you want them to ideally see? Your work experience, your project, or your education. This is how you can arrange these sections. Once you have structured your resume to suit your strengths, the most crucial factor to check is your resume is optimized for ATS. As we saw earlier, most big companies use this software to process resumes at a very initial stage. And the machine shortlists resumes based on the keyword it finds on your resume. There are a few tools that can help you out and one such tool that we found quite useful is this Resume Worlded tool. I've added its link in the description below. Here's how you can use it to check your resume's ATS readiness score. Go to the site link I've shared in the description below. Copy-paste one of the job descriptions based on the role you're looking for. I have added links to a few sample JDs for front-end, back-end, and full-stack roles in the description below. You can use that now to see how this works. Copy-paste your resume. Continue with the next steps shown in the website to generate your score. score above 60 in the skill section. Don't add skills that you're not comfortable with. The score visible on the screen is more of a directional guidance. Mind you, this tool has a finite number of tries for a single email id, so be mindful of this when you're testing out your resume. Now that your resume is ready, the final step is to review it thoroughly. Let's recap the things you have to keep in mind when preparing a resume. Keep your resume no longer than one page. Include personal details so that it's easily accessible to the reviewer's eye. Prepare a draft with information in the following sections. Skills, Projects, Work Experience, Education Background, Achievements, or Extracurriculars. If you're shifting roles, make sure that you have mentioned your objectives clearly at the top. Keep the content crisp. Remove generic sentences and add specific details to describe your work and contributions. Categorize your skills as languages, technologies, tools, and databases, etc. Order your section in such a way that your strengths for the job are highlighted on the top. Use the paper sliding technique to ensure you're ordering your resume with the most important things coming right at the top. Optimize your resume to pass through ATS screening, and at last, get it reviewed by at least two types of people. Someone who knows you. Ask them if your resume reflects your strengths accurately. Someone who doesn't know you. Get an outsider's perspective as this is how the recruiter will look at your resume. For an outsider's perspective on your resume, you can reach out to your seniors or people from the same city on LinkedIn for help. Most of them would be willing to help you. If you ping 10 people, three to four of them may be able to give you some good feedback. And that brings us to the end of this video. If you found this guide useful, share it with your friends on social platforms. Who knows, you could be helping someone who's struggling to craft attention-grabbing resumes for their next job interview. If there is anything else that we missed to share, let's continue that conversation in the comment section. And until next time, all the best for your interviews."

        "transcription": "Everyone has the same dream of becoming a creator. I had the same dream. I wanted to focus on the same line of work. But the reality is that I want to study and do something in the future. Hi everyone, my name is Subedatta and I am from Assam. Recently I am working in Sony as a backend developer and also as a DLP engineer. At that time, computers were getting more and more related. Because Facebook and WhatsApp were coming at the same time. So I was very curious about how everything works. So that's why I chose engineering and applied for JWE. My family had the same internal issues. Then I thought that I will not be able to do B.Tech. I was very down in myself. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't do anything. Then I joined BSc in Assam. After a semester, I felt that this is not for me. I should switch to B.Tech. So I thought about it and switched to B.Tech. Everyone must have faced the same situation in 2020 and 2021. Everyone had to face the same COVID situation. So I lost my DSA skills. After completing all the 4th year exams, there is a 3-month training program in the company. I completed that training program. I sent a lot of emails and tried to talk to HR, but they didn't reply. They didn't send me the joining date. I was in depression because all my friends were settled in good companies because it was almost a year and my one year was ruined I felt that my one year should not be ruined at least I should learn something there was a problem at that time that there was no mentor to show me the right way I was looking for a mentor who can invest his time and learn a lot I was not able to do what Cryo was offering I can do projects there are GitHub links I can build a good resume and I can learn a lot everyone can teach based on theory but it is difficult to learn on a practical basis which I got on Cryo. One thing about Cryo is that the mentors are MNCs, professionals. So what I learned in that one year, I think I was able to learn in those four years. So I joined Sony, which I got a very good hike from my previous company. The projects I built helped me a lot. At the end, I would like to say that you have to have faith in yourself and learn by doing. Mainly, you have to do what you learn. Just learning won't work. If you keep learning, everyone can learn. But if you learn and try in a practical way, you will get more knowledge. But yes, Cryo helped me a lot in moving forward. I learned a lot. I am a driver and I will say that everyone should try."

A competent developer can take the help of AI tools in order to prototype things faster, take some idea to solution much faster. It doesn't mean that the person who is using these AI tools and then building out solutions for the company can take it easy. I mean they'll have a really good job on their hands. They still have to have the customer understanding, the market understanding, the product sense and all those things have to come in. They are the ones who know where this product is going to go in the future and factoring all of that into today's designs, it still needs a very very competent programmer. Some jobs will go but more interesting jobs will come and they'll be large in numbers. Previously people wrote a lot of frameworks, a lot of code in order to serve websites. Frameworks came, some jobs went. But more jobs. Yes, a huge appetite for more jobs."

I noticed that I started writing code in terms like clean code, reusability and readability and I started writing comments between the code to make my code more understandable and more readable. Cryo projects helped me to stand out from the other profiles and improve my CV. Learning content is awesome at Cryo. Future developers of Cryo will get a huge amount of learning.

I got to work on some real-world projects. The curriculum was designed and structured in such a way. That is the same way that we would need to work if we are working as a dev in a company. Whatever we were taught were industry standards. We had a goal that we had to reach every week, some requirements that we had to complete. Here in Cryo, we had mentors. We had sessions as well with them on the weekend to keep our momentum going. I wasn't that confident in my coding rounds previously. After Cryo, I had worked on some of the problem-solving approaches. I had practiced them repeatedly and it definitely improved my confidence in the coding rounds as well. In almost every interview, I was asked how I implemented the projects that I had mentioned in my resume. Previously, I used to, whenever I had a problem, I would start coding. Instead of making a plan, thinking about how to approach it first. So when we had the problem-solving module here, we were given a methodology and there were certain steps in that to approach a problem that helped me improve my problem-solving skills, improve on writing production quality code. As an engineer, you're always curious about how everything works internally. I was able to learn that here with Cryo. When I looked at the curriculum here, I knew that this is something that I want to add in my resume and it acted like a great catalyst for me. The people who have started Cryo as well as the community of learners here, it provides a great environment for you to become a better engineer."

        "transcription": "For this project, we had to make a contextual chatbot. This project was recommended by grow. The main thing we want to achieve from this project is to make the user interaction to get information relevant information interactive rather than static because currently grow has its FAQ section. That is the help section for grow, but it is made up of static pages. So there is no user interaction involved. So through this project we aim to make this process interactive and hence we have built a chatbot for the same. Only grow related questions will be shown to me and I can actually click on these and the relevant answer will be sent back and another thing which we have also implemented is for example, if I go to gold and if I say hi again, so it will as expected it will show me gold related questions. Now, for example, if I ask you directly something like how do I take possession of my gold? So what it will do is it will try to match this question with all the question. It has been trained on and it will return the most relevant answer. Also, I can change the language of this question and still it will be able to identify that. Okay. This question means that I am asking about the possession of my gold which I have stored is no way time for the questions to get trained on. So this was the front end part. Regarding the tech stack, we decided to go with Django as we have built many applications in the past. And for the API construction, we are using the Django REST framework. For the front end part, we are using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Wootstrap. So we are using the SQLite database as our default database because we were thinking of relational database for the storing of a few as well as maintaining the relational table. And for the training of chatbot, we are using the chatterbot library, which is in the AIMLB library for the training part. We are planning to implement a function that can help in adding the dynamic questions as well as answer. a very good approach, different with different approach, good approach, actually, I would say, you had proactively identified the questions in context of where the user is in. And one of the good actually, I would say point was the dynamic configurations, whether it was the context matching for the questions or even adding a new question. So dynamic configuration is very much appreciated. Thank you."

My initial thoughts were basically to get in this program and get some projects and hands-on on real frameworks because before doing Cryo I was also a competitive programmer only doing competitive programming nothing else and I don't have any skills for real world projects so I thought I should join this program. So when I joined the Cryo I got to know that there is a particular way to complete a software project. The testing approach that we got from Cryo was amazing because earlier we used to hit and try some examples and inputs for the programs but Cryo then helped. me to frame the way that we should approach these testing modules and how we can go build a modular system, an amazing system that can work in a real-world scenario. When anyone is thinking about going for a software development or for a developer role, it's all about the approach that one is following because the technology keeps on changing, the frameworks keeps on changing, and also the project keeps on changing in your career. So it's only the approach that helps you to come with these kind of challenges and go through them and solve them. TRIO helped me to get this approach."

I have pursued my engineering from Chennai from the branch of Electronics and Controlling Kingdom.

        "transcription": "In this video, we are going to learn about a concept which is known as Functions. And to understand that, let's have a look on one use case. So what if I wanted to have some formatting to be printed frequently between the results? Something like this. So let's say I have a value 4 after which this formatting should print. After that I have another value, let's say a true, after which this formatting should print. And so on and so on. I want this formatting to be printed after every result that I am printing. So how I would have to go about that? Let's go to repel it and check that. So I would be saying something like a console.log of 2 and I want to have some formatting after that. Let's say console.log of, I'll just have a lot of pluses. Probably then I'll have a console.log of some dashes. Also some.  more pluses. Something like that we would like to have. Let's make it all equal and check how does it look. Okay, so if I try to do this some multiple number of times, let's say I have almost 6 or 7 such values. So I'll just copy and paste it multiple times so that we can understand this better. Let me change these values 2, 3, 4, 5. Here we can make it 6. Finally, a 7. So how does the output look up till now? Let us try to have a look on the same. So I would say node space functions.js and this is how my current looks. After every single number, I have this kind of a formatting. I have this kind of a formatting. But what are we able to observe over here? Now, let's say if I want to make the change to the formatting of all of these lines, I'll have to make it at all these seven places, which is again, some kind of a manual work, but totally feasible to do. What if we wanted to do 1000 number of times, would we manually change all of these formattings from our side? Of course not. Right? So this is one problem we need to consider here. So this is what would happen if we try to print the formatting frequently in between the results. Now, should I repeat these multiple lines in my file itself? Well, that is one question we need to answer, or are there any problems here? So we just saw that we cannot be doing it almost 1000 number of times. So what if I have to make these changes later, then I'll also have to do it several times, which again, we addressed right in the code. So this is how the demo looks like when we do it without a function. Again, we just saw that in the code. Now, how can functions make it better? Let's try to answer. understand that so I can keep all my print statements which are my console.log statements in just a single place and then I can reuse them everywhere Can I do that? Yes, I can do that very well with the help of functions. So any change to the message will also have to be made on that single place itself and at all the places where we are going to call this function it's going to work totally fine. So in JavaScript, whenever we divide up our code into reusable parts, we simply call those blocks as functions. Okay, so let's go and make some examples on the same as well. So first of all, let's also have a look on the syntaxes. So we have a definition of a function looking something like this. How do you create a function in JavaScript? We have a keyword function space, you give the name of the function, then in round brackets you give parameters and you can also not give the parameters, you have both the options. And then in the set of curly brackets, you write your functions body. This is how you write your functions. So according to the previous formatting use case that we discussed, let us try to make an example on the basis of the same. So moving back to repel it, let me comment all of the code that we have written over here and let's make a new function. Let's say function print formatting. This is what I'm going to name my function. And then in my functions body, I'm going to keep all the reusable parts of this code. So in the above code, what is the common part of this code that you can observe? These three lines of code, right? These keep on coming after every result that I'm printing. So let me copy them from here and paste it within my code. I'll uncomment this and all the reusable parts. If you remember the definition of the function, the reusable parts can be kept at a single place and we can keep on reusing them. So I've kept the common part of this code in a function this time. And now how can I replicate the above scenario in lesser lines of code and lesser effort as well? Let us try to see that. So we were doing a console.log of 2 till 7, right? So let me just copy and paste these lines. I'll just make this 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And after every single line, I would, instead of having those three lines, I would simply be calling this function. How do you call a function? Simply by having its name and then these round parentheses. So here's a quick thing that we have to understand about functions. This is the declaration of a function. I will write a comment over here. Declaration of a function. And this is how you call a function, I would say calling a function. So whenever you want the function to be executed, it is mandatory to call that function. These three lines which is a part of this function are only going to be executed when you call this function. So previously we were writing almost 29 lines of code to do this thing. Now we are almost coming down to if you can count it five lines here and then some 12 lines over here. So almost halfway down we have cut the amount of code that we need to write. So whenever we have a piece of reusable code, functions is the best use case for it. And if you remember the problem that we were facing in the last use case, if this was going to be done 1000 times, we had to change it 1000 times manually. No more need of that because all of those can be changed right over here and it would be replicated on all the 1000 times you're going to call this function. So this is how the declaration and calling of a function works. So by this syntax you're going to call a function. Now this time formatting use case with the help of function. So you can clearly see according to this example as well, the formatting moves into the function and it can be called after every single result that you're trying to print. You have to perform an activity on functions. So you have to write a function myName that prints your name to the console once. You have to call this function three times and see if the result changes. So pause this video now. You simply have to implement a function that prints your name and simply call the function three times. Pause the video now and we are going to see this very shortly. All right. So if you have solved it by now, that's pretty great. If you need some help, let's try to get this result. So if I try to solve it on repel it. this is how i would do it i will make the declaration of my function so for that i would say function my name in which i would try to do a console dot log of cryo dot do now if i want to execute this function i have to call the function as well so i would be calling this function three times as asked by the question and we need to observe if the values are changing over here so let's check that node space activity hyphen functions dot js and for all the three times the value gets printed as cryo dot do so obviously the values are not going to change the number of times you're going to call the function the number of times the output is also going to print we are going to talk about the types of functions available in javascript so in the below function we are not sending any input and that's why we call it as a non-parametric function so have a look on this example function greet and in the body we are saying console.log of hi. So in such kind of functions, whenever I'm going to call this function by the name greet, it is always going to print a hi. In such kind of cases, you don't need to provide any inputs to the function. So that is the reason we simply call them as non-parametric function. So whenever you don't pass any parameter to the round brackets, we simply call them as a non-parametric function simply because we have not provided any parameters to the function. Now imagine a banking system where they need to show different personalized messages for the users. So imagine you're going to a bank for opening a new saving bank account. So you must have observed once after you have completed the process, you receive some SMS on your mobile phone, congratulations, comma, your name, you have successfully opened your bank account with XYZ bank. So do you notice is a personalized message right for you. Whenever you're ordering any food from your favorite applications, you must have been able to observe that they send you notifications personalized with your message. So for all those kind of cases, we can pass inputs to the functions, which is why we simply call them as parametric functions. So these are going to be dynamic and it will give different output for different inputs. So we are going to consider examples for both of these categories, nonparametric functions and parametric functions. So let us first of all go back to Repl.it and try to make some examples on the same. So whenever we have function print formatting, now over here, you always want to have a fixed set of message to be printed. console.log cryo.to is the best place. to learn. And after this, I want to have two dashed lines. I want to have a dash here and finally the same dash just below it. Now if I try to call this function printFormatting, I would simply be getting my output as these fixed strings, node space types of functions.js. And as you can see this simply prints it this way. If I call this function multiple number of times, the same number of times the output is going to appear. So whenever we have fixed set of messages, we simply are going to call them as non-parametric functions. I'll write down a comment here, non-parametric functions. Let us also talk about parametric functions by commenting this example and let's make one own example. let us say function print name and let's take in a parameter we are going to call it as name and let's try to have a message printed this time with name getting in consideration. So if I say a console.log of my name is and then I want to concatenate this with name parameter this time when I'm going to call this function print name during the call I have to pass some value for this parameter. Let me just pass it as Rahul and let's check the output this time. And as you can see this time the output comes out to be my name is Rahul. Did you notice the difference between the last use case and this use case previously we were not passing any. parameters. Parameters are a mechanism with the help of which you can give some inputs to the function. Over here, in this case, since it was a fixed message every time, we did not need to pass any parameters. In this case, since we want to print personalized messages by passing different set of inputs, you are going to simply use a parameter. So name is a parameter which we try to declare during the declaration of a function. I would give a comment over here as parameters. And when you call the function, the value that you need to pass for the parameter is simply going to be known as argument. So we can clearly say Rahul is the respective argument for the name parameter. This is exactly how parametric functions work. So if you can see the syntax of the parametric functions, you can pass your parameters just like this in the round bracket and you can have. your dynamic messages accordingly while calling the function you have to pass the respective values for those parameters. So function name of Tina in this case would simply print Hi Tina for the next case it would simply print Hi Arun right. So what are parameters and what are arguments which is something that I've just explained you during the declaration whatever we declare is going to be known as parameters and when we call the function whatever values we pass for them are going to be known as their respective arguments. So I can clearly again say that a deal is the respective argument for this pattern which is declared over here. So this is the difference between parameters and arguments. Let us now also do another demo on the parametric functions. So you have to write a simple parametric function to print a user specific welcome message to the console. And you have to call the function with different usernames as arguments. So in the initial place, we had a use case of banking system which sends personalized messages, right? So let us try to make a parametric function on the same use case. So let's go back to Repl.it. We can comment this one and I'm going to make a new parametric function. Let's call it print bank message. And I'm going to take name as a parameter. And let me say console.log of congratulations, you have successfully opened a saving bank account with XYZ bank. Now this is a fixed message, right? But what if I want to make it personalized according to each person's name, I can have Congratulations. Well, how would I do that? So for that, I would just end this over here. I would say plus name plus I would have the next set of string over here and this is how you can see now whenever I'm going to pass a value for the name, it is simply going to print me a personalized message. Let's do that print bank message for Rahul and let me do it a few more times for different set of names. Let's call the other person as Raj and probably Tina and then finally Arun and let's execute it this time. And as you can see, congratulations Rahul, congratulations Raj, congratulations Tina and congratulations Arun. This is how you can print personalized message with the help of Parallels. metric functions concept. So this is how we could perform the same code demo. Now can you pass multiple parameters to your function as well? Well, of course you can do that. So a function can also have multiple parameters separated by a comma. So after the first parameter, if you need to pass a second one as well or a third one as well, you can simply separate them by commas. Okay. You can also be printing different number of parameters in your functions body as well. So when calling the function, pass each of the arguments again, separated by the commas. So in this case, bond goes to be first parameter, voyage goes to be second parameter. So in the same order, you have to give the arguments as well. So here's another demo that we can have with the multiple parameters. We have to write a parametric function multiply. It takes in two parameters, X and Y and prints the product. of these two numbers on the console. So let's again go back to repel it and have a look on multiple parameters. It's going to be function multiply it takes in two parameters and I can simply say console dot log of x into y and that's it. Let's try by calling this function multiply of three comma five. Let me do it a few more times. We'll keep on changing these values five six and probably sometimes here as well. Okay let's see the outputs and as you can see each time it is simply going to print the product of the two arguments that have passed three into five is fifteen four into five is twenty five times five is twenty five and six times six is thirty six. So this is how we can write multiple parameters in the same function as well. We are going to talk about how do we return values. from functions. So, we can pass values into a function with the help of arguments during we call the function. We can also use a return statement in our function's declaration to send a value back out of a function. So, let us say we have a function known as multiply, it takes in two parameters x and y, and in the function's body we're saying return x into y. Now, how does this make a difference with a console.log and a return statement? So, console.log is simply used to print something on the output, but a return statement is actually bringing this value out of a function which we can store in a variable which can be further used at some later stage of our program. So, the return statement in a function has to be the last statement of the function. After the return statement, any set of statements are simply ignored by JavaScript's execution. So let answer equals multiply of 5 comma 2. Did you notice this time, what is the difference when we are calling the function, we are storing the result of it in an answer variable. So multiply of 5 comma 2 simply means 5 is going to be assigned to x, 2 is going to be assigned to y, return x into y, which means return 5 into 2, which makes it a return 10. This value 10 is going to be returned from this function and it is going to be stored into the answer variable. So that is how we return values from functions. So let us also see the same with the help of a demo. So let us see, we have a function multiply, it takes in two parameters and we are saying return x into y, right? And let's say, let answer equals multiply. multiply of 5, 2 and then let us also do a console.log of answer. Alright, let us now have a look on the result, node space return values, ok let's run this again, yeah and as you can see the answer comes out to be 10. Now if I was going to write a console.log of hi, after my return statement what is going to happen? Is this line going to print or not? You can see it is not printing. So the return statement has to be the last statement of our function's declaration. If you are going to write anything after that, it is simply going to be ignored by JavaScript's execution. So this is how returning values from function works. no return value specified, then js will always return undefined as a default return value in case of functions."

So the service which maintain that that I like develop on it and kind of a secondary owner. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. So what what are some practices that you do as a software developer to calm yourself or ground yourself? So yeah, we do have some situations though, like there is a very priority task we have to work on. And I think there are also times where I don't have that much work. So there's kind of in compensation. So, we just make our mind like that, okay, this has to come someday. If you could have dinner with Elon Musk, what is one question you would ask him? I'll ask him to give just 0.001% of his net worth. That should be enough, yeah. All right, thank you so much."

        "transcription": "Hey, would you allow an uncertified doctor to perform a surgery on you? Of course not. You rely on their years of medical training and experience. But building a software is not the same. Anyone can become a software developer. You don't even require an engineering degree to become one. All you need is careful preparation and willingness to learn the technical skills. Hi, I'm Rithvik. And today we are going to see how doable this transition plan is for you. As I walk you through the three stages of this process. Watch this video till the end and find out what you will be doing at each stage and how you can land your first software job. If you like the video, let us know with a thumbs up and subscribe to our channel to stay updated with our new videos in the coming weeks. It's not a secret that technology has changed everything, how we communicate, how we shop and even how we travel. Tech has disrupted it all. For example, just look at the food industry. like swiggy and zomato have made our life much easier or if you want to book a cab or auto uber and ola have got you covered there every single domain you can think of is enabled by tech this is the reason why software engineers are in a huge demand and if you build your career as a software developer you can easily cross 40 to 50 lakhs per annum within 10 years so regardless of your current background if you think that you want to work in software development for the next 10 to 15 years switching your job to this field is worth the effort now that you have decided to build a career in this field let's see how you can get there one step at a time to be honest this isn't going to be a smooth transition without a proper plan so let's break your plan down to three stages with clear goals for each stage in stage one focus on getting comfortable with basic coding then stage two your end goal would be to get your first software job and finally in stage strengthen your foundations for a smoother growth in your career and before we get into the details of each stage i want to tell you that it is absolutely normal if you feel nervous nervous about making this transition, especially if you aren't confident about your coding skills. Feeling nervous means you have already begun your learning journey. Do you know about the three zones of learning? This is beautifully explained by Udacity in a video. I'm adding the link to the video in the description. You can check it out and come back to this video. You're right now feeling nervous to step foot into the stretch zone. It's part of the process. However, when you get past this zone, you're going to appreciate yourself by staying committed to your goal and achieving new heights in your career. If you agree and are liking the video so far, click on the thumbs up and let's begin with stage 1 of your transition process. The first stage is all about coding. To become a software developer, coding is the primary requirement. The first question to address here is, do you have the basic understanding of coding? Have you ever written code as part of your school or college curriculum? Or were you ever around a programmer who rubbed off on you and you got excited about coding? If you have answered yes to the above questions, the first step for you is to get comfortable with writing 20 lines of program. And if you haven't done any coding earlier, it's time for you to start learning. the basics of programming. There are plenty of resources available online. To make things easier, I have shared some useful resources in the description. You can get started from there. There will be times when you run into the strangest of errors that will drive you nuts. It's not just a beginner's problem. This is going to be a frequent story of your coding life. It's funny when you finally debug it and realize how silly of a problem it was. If you have ever run into something like this, share with us in the comment section. It's always fun to read through these comments. Once you've gotten the hang of coding, it's time to move on to stage two of your transition journey. As I said earlier, your ultimate goal is to get to your first software job. And as we know, to get a job, you need experience. But for experience, you need a job. But the good news is that most software companies focus on the skills you demonstrate rather than your degree or past experience. This is a huge plus in the software industry. Let's see how you can take advantage of this and build a new career in this field. Number one, work on at least three to four projects to improve your development skills. As you work on the projects, you not only get hands-on experience, it's also the best shot to make your resume. stand out. When hiring managers see your project experience, they would be convinced that you're serious about this transition. So be sure to pick the right projects that get you shortlisted for the role. You can pick up any project from Cryos project hub. The link for the hub is in the description. Every project there will add great value to your skill set and you can complete them by following instructions that come with the project. But if you're still not able to do the projects, a structured curriculum will definitely help you learn the necessary skills for your job. Or if you have someone to mentor you, you can work on the projects by yourself as well. Once your resume is shortlisted, your next goal is to clear the interview rounds. DSA and system design are the two most important concepts that are going to be tested in your interviews, along with tech knowledge required for the job. If you do the projects by yourself, you would easily be able to tackle the tech questions thrown at you. But for DSA and system design, you require a slightly different study plan. We have covered a detailed video on how you can approach your DSA preparation for interviews. Do watch that and get a clear idea of what you need to do and where to start. You can watch it right after this video. added the link to the video in the description. If you followed everything that I have said till now, there's nothing that can stop you from getting your first software job. However, there's a small catch here. It's not enough just to prepare from the point of view of getting selected for the job. Unless you have a smart strategy to find the job, you're not even going to have the opportunity to put your preparation to the test. Let's look at five strategies you can adopt during your job search. If you even use three out of these five strategies that I'm about to share, I promise that you will definitely increase your chances of getting more interview calls. Number one, try for an internal transfer. Before looking elsewhere, see if you can switch within your own current company. Just talk to your manager and let them know that you're picking up skills to move to a development role. When you have the discussion, make sure that you share the timeline of your transition plan. Say you tell your manager that you want to switch the job in next two quarters. This gives your manager enough time to find your replacement and without agreeing upon a timeline, they may never prioritize this transition plan for you. Option two, explore freelancing opportunities. You can look for a freelance job in places like Upwork, Topcoder. and Turing. Freelancing is actually an amazing practice to help you build up your dev profile and dive deeper into the areas that interest you in development. And of course, you would be earning on the site to get hands on with the necessary skills. If everything works out well, it could even turn into a full time role. You can also start by working with someone who is already a freelancer and learn the tricks of the trade before venturing out on your own. Coming to the third strategy, apply to smaller companies. Smaller companies are more open to evaluating you based on your skills than your degree. If your project experience meets what they're looking for in a candidate, they would definitely consider you for the role. They wouldn't reject you because you're currently working in a different field. It's usually a win-win situation as they can hire you for a salary slightly less than the market salary for a similar experienced person. And you get an amazing opportunity to move into development. When you're about to apply to such companies, try this small trick. It could work like magic for you. Approach them by saying you can implement something for them by working without compensation for a week just to prove your skills before they hire you. If you're finding these strategies valuable so far, like the video and let us know before we move on to the next two strategies. The fourth thing that you can do is take advantage of your current domain knowledge. For example, if you're from pharma, banking or insurance domain, some companies may find this expertise of you a great addition to their team. They would be willing to give you the opportunity. And at last, the fifth and final strategy that you must adopt is, apply to as many companies as you can. This would increase the chances of you getting that first interview call. If you apply for 10 companies, only two or three may call you for an interview, which is absolutely fine. All you need to do is convert them to one or two offers at the end of the day. So, leave no stones unturned when it comes to getting your first software job. Given that you will work for at least 15 to 20 years in the software industry, the hustle is worth the jump in terms of your career growth and salary growth. So far, we have seen what you need to do to get started with your transition plan and how you can get your first software job in this new field. However, your journey doesn't end here. Many people ignore the third stage that completes the transition plan and as a result end up feeling lost and intimidated after they have stepped into their new career. Let's see why. So you join as a front-end developer and in various meetings you attend, you keep hearing words like normalization, docker, blob storage, CICD and you feel completely lost. This is probably because you didn't spend time learning about it during your interview preparation. Not a great situation to be in, right? You're not going to face this on a daily basis in your new job but it is always good to continue covering gaps in your computer science fundamentals from the day you start your new job. Some useful areas you could start investing in are databases. You most definitely will need to have sound knowledge about how databases work. A strong foundational understanding of operating systems and networking can go a long way in your software career. Data structures and algorithms. You can easily get lost solving a problem or debugging if you haven't covered a good breadth of TSA concepts. And fourth, get a deep understanding of the cloud. Upscaling yourself constantly is very important. Even if you won't be working on the concepts on a day-to-day basis. it's going to help you in your career in the long run. So we have looked at where you can start your transition journey, what to do at every stage of the process, and how to make your mark in the software industry. But some of you may be wondering which role to go after and that in itself can be quite confusing. If you're watching this video at a point where you have already chosen your role, let us know in the comments below and do share your thoughts on why you chose the role. Someone watching this video might connect with your perspective and your comment could help them choose their role. How we see this is that there are two major roles to target that would be easy to pick up and would offer you a promising career. Front-end developer roles. This one is slightly easier to crack compared to other roles. It involves you building beautiful static or dynamic websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript or libraries or frameworks like React and Angular. The other one is Python development roles. This is also a great role to begin with because once you learn Python, you can leverage that to do a bunch of different things like building tools, automating workflows, building simple applications and with a bit of AWS Azure. and GCP exposure, this role can open up several big opportunities as well. So find the role that suits you the best and work on building up the skills you need for that job role. If you found this video useful, do like the video and share it with your friends, letting them know how this transition plan changed your career path. If you are new to the channel and haven't yet subscribed, don't leave without hitting that bell icon for more such career guidance and practical insights for the tech industry.

Then I started looking for a job and not getting any opportunity and offers because of the lack of experience I have in the technology area. So I found Cryo and then joined Cryo to upskill myself as a backend developer. I like the structuring and the program curriculum, like how they are going ahead with the program, like from beginning to the end where I can develop any software and fix any debug and issues. I actually learned a lot about technology, about how to like handle situations where I got stuck, learn how to solve DSA programs and learn many more things. The best part was like the hands-on. practice for like I was barely able to like cope up with the of styles and how to structure the code properly after this one I learned like how to cope up with things and the structuring of program and all the things during the program I have gone to a few projects like to money to aids and x-mean which like helped me to view how the industrial level projects are built cryo has a very vast course and very unique course so you can really get to learn the things from the scratch and then build it up to the level where companies started to notice you like he has done some good projects."

        "transcription": "Hey, this is Rathina, co-founder at Career.do. This is Career Cafe. Hey, as usual, today we are going to answer some of the most frequently asked questions from our learners. Let me pick up today's question. Today's question is, I have two years of experience with manual testing. Can I switch into development? Let me say some perspective, right? A lot of students don't get to choose their first job. Most often, they sit in the campus placement, they get placed in probably first day or second day, they join a company, and after some time, they realize that's not something they want to do for the rest of their career. Let me explain this with an example of a user, Amit. Amit studies in a tier 3 college, where TCS comes on a day one, and he gets placed. And after six months, he joined TCS as a system engineer with a lot of dreams. And after training, he got allotted to the manual testing project. He joins there, he enjoys the initial days of working with clients, taking late-night calls, goes on. After a couple of months, he really gets frustrated with his work and his work quality. He thinks he doesn't enjoy doing manual testing. He has a moderate interest in programming, he has done some small projects in college, he thinks he can really enjoy doing development. But time flies, he almost spends two years, his frustration only goes up. His question to us is, after being two years into manual testing, can I actually switch to development? My answer to someone like Amit is, yes, you can definitely switch. If you plan and prepare well, that's absolutely possible in your early career, right? So what do you need to do? Typically, if you look at Amit, there are three problems he has. has, he's been working as a manual tester for the last two years. He's out of touch from programming. His foundation of programming is so weak. He's out of touch from problem solving as well. When he applies for a developer job, he doesn't have any relevant experience. Nobody shortlists him. Third, he does not have any confidence or any skills, any tech stack. So how should we think about guiding Amit forward? First thing is, if he's clear he wants to do development, he has to believe that he can do it. And he has to start strengthening his programming foundations. It could be any language. It could be Java, JavaScript. It could be any language. Once he's very, very clear with his programming, he can spend some time improving his problem solving skills, his data search and algorithmic skills. Once he has done that, he has to pick up a tech stack. Let's say it could be Java or it could be JavaScript. In a platform like Cryo, we actually help people to do work-life, real-world projects. So he has to work on projects. He has to be. build a portfolio. Let's say tomorrow he's applying for a job. He can't say, I've been doing manual testing all this while. I want to do development. That's just a wish. Instead of that, he can go back and say, I want to do development. Last one year, I actually worked really hard. I built all this project. This is my portfolio. That actually speaks. And once he has programming foundations, his problem-solving foundations, and he has the real work portfolio, definitely he can actually apply for jobs. And he has a better chance of getting shortlisted. We have helped hundreds of people like Amit, working in large services companies, working in system administration roles, manual testing roles, doesn't have any relevant experience. We helped a lot of them actually move into development roles. Yes, the job search process is slightly trickier. A lot of smaller companies, a lot of startups are actually willing to take a bet on these people as long as they have a real skill set. I think that's why a platform like Cryo can actually help for somebody to actually build a real practical skill set and showcase the demonstrable work proof. The short answer and summary is somebody like Amit who's working. a manual tester for two years, three years, can definitely move to development if that's what they want to do. They just need to plan and prepare well, right? They need to build their programming foundations. They need to build their real work portfolio. They need to improve their experience on one tech stack. That's definitely possible. Yeah, all the best for all the Amints out there. That's all for today, folks. If you have more questions, leave them in the comments. We'll pick them up and put them in the questions bowl. See you in the next video."

        "transcription": "I was working as a software engineer. I wanted to have a change. I wanted to switch from the service-based to product-based and want to see how we work in a product-based environment. Then I came across the profile for Cryo. When I joined the program, they offered me a micro experience where I was learned how the actual product is built in some of the most prestigious product-based company. It gave me a huge exposure. How do we write the code actually in terms of reusability, in terms of testing, in terms of maintainability, readability. So that micro experience was something like a game changer for me. The community was really, really supportive. They supported me. As I did, I learned and I grew. Learn by doing was something very enjoyable and really helpful for me. My writing style has improved. modularising the code has been improved. I know how to test it. I know how to manage my coverage of our code. If you ask me that if I see how I write my code an year back and how I write my code now, would be a huge difference. Whenever I applied to a company, they noticed, hey, they did micro experience with cryo. Let's give him a chance to give an interview. So it was like a boost for me. I would recommend future developers to trust their program. They have been designed very extensively for giving you a real world experience. They will understand how the things works in real world. If they have not been exposed to that before, they will definitely be exposed in the scribe program."

        "transcription": "Welcome back and in this particular video we will be discussing the problem find triplet with maximum sum in unsorted array. The problem statement is we are given an array nums we need to find the maximum sum of triplet that is three elements nums of i plus nums of j plus nums of k we have to find a sum of three elements such that all the three elements having the indices i j k should be greater than equal to zero and it should be less than the last index obviously it should be within the array but i should be less than j j should be less than k that is nums of i plus nums of j plus nums of a should be maximum but along with a constraint that i should be less than j j should be less than k and obviously i will be also be less than k. One more condition is there and nums of i should be less than k. less than nums of j nums of j should be less than nums of k that is they should be in the increasing order the three elements which we are about to pick should be in the increasing order and should be from left to right and if no such triplet exists we have to print zero so that is most probably a corner case where there might be no possible triplet so let's understand this problem using a input format the input is there are two t plus one lines of input what do you mean by that that t represents the number of test cases so there will be multiple test cases in each of the test case we will be given integer n that is a number of elements in the array array size and second element will be the second line will be for each test case representing the all the elements in the array so for each test case what we have to do we have to find the maximum sum according to the constraints so if i just write the same thing in terms of a simple formula we have to do array of i or you can say nums of i plus array of j plus array of k this sum should be maximum this sum should be maximum but along with a constraint that is i should be less than j j should be less than k along with area of i should be less than area of j should be less than area of k and they should be strictly less than each other they should not also be equal because it is specifically mentioned that we have to do less than only so first test case let's understand each of the test cases one by one first test case is there are seven elements three seven four two five seven five let's bring this test case into the notes and let's try to understand so example number one is three seven four then there is three seven four two five seven five so what triplet should i choose in order to form the maximum sum with the conditions matched with the constraints matched if i take i as a three what will i take j j should be after the i because i is smaller than j j is smaller than k so if i take i as zero j will be at least one or it can be more than one also that is at least it should be greater than zero so if i pick i as nums of i three so nums of j should be greater than three strictly greater than three it can be seven it can be four it can be two it can be five it can be seven it can be it cannot be two actually but why because nums of j cannot be smaller than nums of i so if i let's take j as seven then what can be k k should be after j only that is from second index till last index but its value should also be strictly greater than nums of j that is seven is there any value after seven more than seven no so i cannot actually pick j as a seven what if i pick j as second index having value four in that case k can be picked anything from three to six which is having more value than four so ideally what could I pick should I pick the minimum value or should I pick the maximum value if we need the maximum sum of the triplet we need to pick the maximum value so if I pick K as a fifth index then it will be seven and in that case what will be the sum of this triplet the sum of this triplet nums of I plus nums of J plus nums of K will be 3 plus 4 7 7 plus 7 that is 14 actually is 14 the maximum sum no actually 16 is the maximum sum which which triplet is it going to give me 16 some let's see if I am not taking 4 as day if I am taking 5 as day in that case it might give me better result similarly instead of taking I as zeroth index having value 3 if I take I as second index having value 4 in that case it will give me a better result a maximum result maximum sum with all the conditions matched that is nums of I is smaller than nums of J is smaller than nums of K I is smaller than J is smaller than K And what is the sum in this case the maximum sum is nothing but 4 plus 5 plus 7 which is nothing but 16 I guess so 9 plus 7 which is 16 and it is the maximum sum according to the output also. Let's try to understand the second test case also which is saying that there will be four values 5 2 4 5 four values are there example 2 which is having 5 2 4 5. Now according to this particular array if I take the first element I as zeroth index then I have to take j as a value jth index having a value more than 5 but now we cannot take any j value so I cannot be 5 I cannot be having a value 5 what if I is equal to 1 that is having value 2 in that case I can take j as 4 and k as 5 so this is actually the only possible triplet where i will be lesser than j j will be lesser than k also nums of i nums of j nums of k will be in increasing order. will be the maximum sum in this case it will be 2 plus 4 plus 5 which is i guess 11 so if the second test case answer will be 11 what about the third test case this is very important the third test case is three elements having value 3 2 1 so what will happen in the third test case having three values 3 2 1 let me draw it three values 3 2 1 so zeroth index first index second index only three values are there what if i take i as zeroth index having value 3 i have to take j having some value more than 3 but there is no value more than 3 after i so i cannot take i as 0 what if i take i as first index having value 2 now again i have to take j something greater than 2 j value having something greater than 2 value but it is not possible similarly if i take i as 1 that is nums of 2 then j cannot be taken at all because there is no more element after it so actually you cannot take any triplet in this case and if no triplet is present what was the question saying the question was saying that we have to print zero if no such triplet found maximum sum should be printed as zero so this is the corner case so we have to also take care of this corner case where there is no triplet present so now that we are done with the first milestone that is understanding the problem clearly with the sample test cases now let's move on to the second milestone that is how we can approach this problem what can be the brute force approach see while we were explaining or we were trying to find an intuitive way the most basic way the first thing which will comes to our mind is try to find all the triplets possible so if I am going to find the all the triplets possible that is going to be the brute force approach only why because if I am going to find all the triplets then what will be the time complexity to find all the triplets So, first loop will be required to find the i pointer, second loop will be required to find the j pointer, third loop will be required to find the k pointer. So, i pointer if it is running from 0 till n minus 1, j pointer should be running after i only that is from i plus 1 till n minus 1 and where should k pointer be running? K pointer should be running from the j plus 1 pointer till n minus 1 that is after the j pointer only. So, these three loops will be running as a nested loop only, why? Because once we pick i, we can pick anything as j and once we pick j, we can pick anything as k according to the constraints and whichever triplet will give me the maximum sum, I will choose it. So, find all triplets and take the maximum sum which is following the constraints with the constraints followed with constraints followed. What will be the time complexity of this particular loop? particular approach using brute force since there are three loops nested in inside one another the total time complexity will be n raised to the power 3 that is cubic time complexity although we will not be taking any extra space because we will be doing it without any data structure without any storage we will just simply travel on the input array itself but can we do anything better than n cube actually yes see in brute force what we are doing we are first picking the element i then we are picking the element j then we are picking the element k in the order i j k in the order of increasing nature that is first i then j then k in this fashion if we are going to pick the elements in this particular order we cannot optimize or even if we try to optimize it will not be able to basically bring down the time complexity so what is the approach if i am not picking the elements in here increasing order it will basically help me to get the answer in lesser time complexity if I change the order of picking the values that is if let's say instead of first picking I if I first pick J then what will happen let's see let's try to understand what will happen if I will first pick J for the same test case for the same example test case so right now we are discussing the optimized approach in which we are trying to find all the triplets only but in such a manner that first we will pick J first let's pick J that is the middle value middle index value IJK the middle value one value will be left one value will be right I and J actually I and K so first we will pick the middle value and then if I pick I as well as K will it be helping me in reducing the time complexity that we are trying to do a driver on so seven 3 7 4 2 5 7 5 3 7 4 3 7 4 2 5 7 5 is the array and we need to find the maximum sum triplet following the conditions initially if I pick the middle value j first as 3 that is 0th index having value 3 I can be before it only ith index should be less than jth index but there is no ith index possible so this j cannot be taken we cannot take j as 0th index now let's try to take j as first index if I take j as first index the value is 7 so what is the constraint for i and k for left and right values i should be having a value lesser than 7 that is nums of i or you can say array of i should be lesser than nums of 7 and it should be in the right side that is from 0 till j minus 1 whatever. the k value the kth index should be in the range after j only that is array of j should be actually more than 7 the value of nums of j and also it should be in the range j plus 1 till the last index that is till n minus 1th index that is array of i should be lesser than array of j instead of 7 I am writing array of j a generic term similarly array of k this is not array of j this is array of k array of k that is the last value should be more than array of j then only it will become increasing array of i then array of j and then array of k if this condition is matched then we will say the triplet is valid so let's try to see if we are picking the j value as a 7 what can be i can I take i as 0 yes the array of i is less than array of j as well as it is within the range from 0 to j minus 1 that is I will be running the loop only in the left direction so yes I can say I can be picked as three what about k i should pick k after j only that is from j plus one can i pick k as four no it is not more than seven can i pick k as two no can i pick k as five no can i pick k as seven no can i pick k as five the value no so again if j is a seven that is first index the no triplet is valid none of the triplet is valid so let's try to take j as the second index so i am trying to figure out every j possible index that is from zero till last index now what should be the i index in this scenario i index can be anything from one or zero and the second constraint is the value should be less than four so i should not pick seven because seven is more than four i can pick i as three because it is less than four what about k k should be after j can i pick two no it is not more than four not yes i can pick actually five but should i pick five or should i pick seven i should pick the value which will contribute to the maximum sum that is i should pick seven only so in this case k will be seven that is fifth index i will be zeroth index having value three what will be the triplet sum it will be three plus four plus seven it might be the maximum it might not be we will try to figure out more triplets so j having value second index is done now i will try for the next j index that is i will now try for the third index as j similarly i will try for the fourth index as j so let's do a drive in for fourth index as j if j is the fourth index i can be less than j that is from j minus one till zeroth index whichever value is just greater actually just just smaller just smaller than the array of j but it should be the maximum one so what is this definition this definition is nothing but floor two is smaller than five but 4 is better answer. Why? Because I need the maximum sum. I cannot pick 5. I cannot pick 7 in i but I can pick 4 because 4 is smaller than 5. 4 is smaller than numsubj. Should I pick 3? No, I will not be picking 3 because I want the maximum sum. Although 3 is less than 5, these two conditions are valid. But among all these values, whichever value provides these two conditions as well as it is the maximum one, I will take that. So, I will take 4, just a smaller value than the jth value, than the numsubj. What about k value? I will be searching k in the right-hand side, that is after j. But in the right-hand side, I will be searching not for just smaller, I will be searching for maximum actually because I can take 7 also because num of k or array of k should be more than array of j. So, it can be maximum. So, if I take these three elements, the sum will be 4 plus 5 plus 7 is even more than the previous triplet sum and this is actually equal to 16 which is the best possible triplet in this version you will be trying to figure out every triplet possible so if we are first fixing the value of j if we are first fixing the middle value then searching for the left value that is i value can be done in a loop order of n searching for the right side value that is k value can again be done in order of n value but these two loops are they nested now no they are one after the other they are just a single loop actually like n plus and not n into n they are not nested in this case first fix j and then after fixing j run a loop for i as well as k together so we can say overall time complexity in this case will become how much n for fixing the value of j into n plus n so this n is due to fixing j this n is due to i this is due to k but now it is not n into n this is n plus n because inner two loops will be not nested they will be one after the other what about space complexity again we will actually not take any extra space we will be doing it in constant extra space only because we only need a variable maximum initially maximum will be how much initially maximum should be zero because if there is no triplet it should be zero by default then we will try to update the maximum sum as as and when we are getting a better triplet finally whatever the maximum sum will be we will return that so this is the approach which we are trying to optimize by first picking the middle value and how i came to this approach by seeing that if we pick the elements in increasing order we are taking three loops but if we pick the middle value then we can pick the left value and right value together it will optimize the code it will reduce the time complexity so now that we have done with the second milestone that is finalizing the approach we will be coming up to the instruction manual so first of all what you will need we will need to run a trader or run a pointer for the middle element that is a chair index so run a loop we will say run a loop for a pointer in the array or over the array from zero index till the last minutes actually even if we start from the first index and go till n minus 12 index it will still work fine why because the jth index should never be the first index or the jth index should never be the last index the zeroth index or the last index actually why because if j will be zero there will be no i index possible if j will be the sixth index last index there will be no k index possible so for better optimization what we can do is we can say the run loop for j pointer over the array from 1 till n minus 2 even if you run it from 0 to n minus 1 it will still work fine so for now I am writing it as 0 to n last index but you can do it if you wish from 1 till n minus 2 also so since the array is given in long why it is given as a long integer and the return type also as long because the sum of three integers can go up till 3 into 10 raise power 9 that is it will go more than the range which is given as an integer integer usually is maximum as approximately 2 into 10 raise power 9 so to incorporate the maximum sum overflow we are taking it as long instead of basically taking it as integer and constraints is there might be 100 test cases each test case can have at max 300 elements in the array so most probably our code will work fine so let's say that the run a loop for jpointer once we have fixed the jpointer will run a loop or actually let's run a loop on a different function let's have a different function so we will say get the i value get the array of i value array of i value from a function which is get i from a function get i at the index get i at index similarly get the array of k value from a function which is get jth index but if we need to get the ith index if we need to get the kth index what we need to do we need to say that we have to pass the jth index also because according to that we will choose which i index should we take we will choose which k index should we take why because array of i should be smaller than array of j array of k should be greater than array of j array of i should be smaller than array of j as well as i should be smaller than j similarly the k should be greater than j so i will be passing the jth index in these two functions so let's have these two functions which will return me long that is get the higher index so even if you want to return integer we can why because we will only get the index or you can actually return the value if you want directly so for now I am saying get the higher index and initially what it will say it will take the long array along with the long array it will also take one more thing which is the jth index because we need to find the higher index before the jth only similarly I will be having one more function which will get the jth actually the jth index which will take the array same as the previous function the long array as well as the integer j because we need to find k after jth only once we get the ith index once we get the jth index we will say check whether this sum area of I plus area of J plus area of K but is greater than maximum sum or not so we have to initialize a long variable which is maximum sum variable initially to 0 set to 0 initially because maximum sum if it is not present if any triplet is not satisfying the criteria you have to take it as 0 only so take the triplet and now check if array of i plus array of j plus array of k that is a sum of the triplet is more than the max sum then update the maximum then update the max sum as a triplet as the current triplet sum okay and finally what should we do we should return the maximum sum triplet that is maximum sum variable so this is the main function logic but what we have to do in the get ith index we have to choose such an index from range run a loop from range what from 0 till j minus 1 because it should be smaller than j but choose the value which is the floor of array of J so initially I will assume assume the answer as what assume the answer as zero because for now I am assuming it is not present at all and we will be running a for loop over all the elements from 0 to J minus 1 run of for loop over all the elements from 0 to J minus 1 for the ith index for the ith index and let's say what that if array of current index I is smaller than array of J then yes it is following the condition if yes then what should we do we should say answer should be maximum update answer as maximum of the current answer and the previous answer update answer as maximum of current value and answer till now and answer till now that is answer variable finally what should we return we should return the other variable same goes for the get kth index also so for get kth index index what we need to say we will say assume the answer as 0 but now this time we have to run a for loop for which range for j plus 1 till last index that is till n minus 1 for the kth index if array of k should be more than array of j because we have to do it in increasing order if it is more than array of j then update the answer as the maximum of current value and the answer and finally return the answer but will this code work for every corner test case actually no why if i am let's say assuming if i am let's say assuming that the j value is zeroth index having array of j as three what will be i i will be saying that i loop will not run so what it will return me it will return me zero what will the j loop return the j loop will actually return what it will return again zero why because there is no value more than three in the right side so will your sum be zero plus three plus zero will it be three no actually no sum exists so if no triple it exists we have to not update it so only update the answer if the value if the index or we can say if the answer we are getting is not the zero answer if it is not zero then only updated why because array values are at least one each element in the array is having at least value one so what should we say we should say that update the sum as the maximum sum triplet only if only if area of i is more than zero as well as array of a is more than zero that is both the left hand side and right hand side variables exist that is a triplet is valid then only update transfer now finally our pseudobot is complete so this is the instruction manual let me just bring this and with that we are done with the third module which is coming up with the instruction manual let me just bring this instruction manual in the notes and what you have to do is using this instruction manual you have to think how you can put your solution in any particular programming language so what we have to do first of all we have to initialize the maximum sum as zero because if no triplet exists we have to assume that the maximum sum is zero in the problem statement is what it was mentioned now optimized approach was that we have to run a jloop over the array from zeroth index up till the last index up till the array dot length minus one that is less than array dot length j plus plus now once we have run the loop over the array what we will say we will say that get the ith value array of i value from the function get array get in index so i will say long so better will be to actually take long as a return type why because we will be returning the values even if you return integer you have to return index but if you directly want to return the value you should return long so long I will say let's say array of i is an ith value ith value is equals to get ith index and I will be saying pass the array pass the jth index similarly get the jth value jth value in a variable jth value and call the function get actually not jth but get the eth value this is eth index from the function where I will pass the array as well as j that is find the left value to the middle and find the right value to the middle according to the constraints once we have figured out both the values we will be checking if array of i that is the ith value ith value plus the array of j plus the jth value if this triplet is more than the maximum sum then what should we do we should update the maximum sum only if array of i is more than zero as well as array of k is more than zero so we will say if we can have a and operator if you you can do a nested if also it is your wish so I will be saying and operator ith value should be more than zero similarly the kth value should also be more than zero why because if I am having the test case where there were only three elements and the third element was actually having the values what the third element let me just go to the page where we are done a try and guess if there are only three values in decreasing order then you cannot pick any triplet in that case there will be no I possible no k possible we will return zero so if I is zero or k is zero there is no triplet do not update the sum otherwise we can update the sum as maximum sum will be math dot max of maximum sum till now or the current sum that is I of 12 plus array of j plus the kth value the array of i plus array of j plus array of k finally we should return the maximum sum so this is the main function hopefully the main function will work for all the test cases given that we are able to find the ith index and kth index properly so for them what we have to do we have to assume initially the answer is zero long answer is equal to zero and we will run a loop for the ith index in the left range only that is for int i is equal to zero i is less than j only up till less than j and we will ask is the ith value better than the jth value if array of i is actually lesser than the array of j because it should be in increasing order what we have to do we have to update the answer as the maximum till now so if this is true we will say answer will be maximum of math dot max of answer till now and the array of current array of i finally we will return the answer similarly so before actually like uh running the code before actually writing the code for kth index let's just say return zero in get kth index and see if till now we are getting the correct triplet or not like ith index if we are getting correct or not at least the two functions are correct so the output which we are getting is currently zero why because kth value for now we are returning is zero and zero is not more than zero so we are not able to update the maximum sum so for that what should we do we should complete the second function that is the get here index we will not be able to do a dry run without that so first let's complete it which is almost the same but for kth index that is after the j we will be running the loop for k from j plus one till the last until the less than array dot length and j plus plus obviously so over this array we will be asking this time if array of k is more than array of j because it should be a strictly greater range and if it is strictly more than the value we should update the value as well. what we should update the maximum value answer value as math dot max of answer till now and the current array of k finally we will return the same as the previous code so if we will run this code let's see if it is working for all the sample dash cases or not we will also see it for the corner cases so if it will work for sample dash cases actually it is showing me some array index out of bound exception somewhere it is going outside the array let's see we are running a loop from 0 till less than array dot length j plus plus we are getting the ith index we are getting the kth index and using those indices we will be saying if i plus j plus k the values sum is more than maximum sum as well as i is more than 0 k is more than 0 we will update the maximum sum as the triplet current triplet sum and return the maximum sum so main logic is working fine let's see it for the get kth index initialize answer as 0 run a loop from 0 till less than j if array of i is less than array of j then update the answer and finally return the answer so i guess this is also correct what about the get care index we will run a loop for k so actually we are not updating k pointer we are by mistake doing the j pointer updation so k should be running from j plus one till less than array dot lin and if array of k is more than array of j what should we do we should update the answer i hope if after this correction if we will run the code it will work fine for the sample let's run it and see so sample test case as discussed last test case where there is no triplet answer is zero where there was some triplets answer was 11 and for the first test case where we are doing proper try run the answer was coming out to be 16 so it is working for all the sample test cases what will happen if the array is let's say containing only three values so if i say there are only three values let's say there is only one test case only three values are there 10 20 30 in this case is there any triplet yes i will be 10 j will be 20 k will be 30 the values so some will be 60 i guess yes some is coming out to be 60 what will happen if i will take 10 10 10 that is all the values are same in that case since there is no triplet because value should be strictly increasing answer should be zero because there is no triplet which is valid so if it is going to give me zero then i will submit the code for all the bigger dash cases yes so let's submit it and actually all the eight test cases are working let's just bring this code and discuss what is the time complexity and the space complexity so get kth index what is the time for get kth index since we are running a loop a single loop from i 0 till less than j it is order of n what about the second function that is the get kth index it is also running a loop from j plus 1 till less than array dot length this is order of n also depending on whatever j is but is linear in worst case what will happen for the main function in the main function we are running a loop for j so order of n for that and then running two loops simultaneously one after the other not one inside the other so it is order of 2n into order of n that is order of 2n square and not order of n cube so it is quadratic time complexity and not the cubic time complexity so we are able to optimize the time complexity from the previous solution so for this particular problem the time is nothing but order of n square that is quadratic space how much we are taking we are not taking any extra space so constant extra space so this is the optimized approach i hope the code is visible you can see the entire code and also if you want to submit it any other language you can do one follow up which i want to give is can you try to optimize it even better than n square you have to think in terms of that and for that the hint will be that you need a floor value or a seal value something like that because in the left-hand side you need the maximum value lesser than numsubj that is you need a floor value actually so if you need a floor value some data structure which will help to sort the data as well as search the data in efficient manner it will help so if you are able to sort the data that is insert all the elements in a sorted order and then search the floor value in most optimized manner then that will help you to even further reduce the time complexity this will be for the left index what will happen for the right index that is kth index for that you have to think in terms of suffix some why because we do not need steel we do not need floor for right side we need the maximum value if the maximum value after j so for that we do not need just greater we need the overall maximum global maximum so think in terms of suffix sum plus the data Data structure can be ordered set, it can be binary search, it can be anything and that follow up will be taking order of n log n time complexity and it will take also some space but that follow up is just if you know the data structures well, if you know those kind of data structures. So I am giving you a follow up where you have to solve this problem, same problem in order of n log n time complexity and space is equals to order of how much, order of n space complexity due to the data structure, due to the ordered set. In some programming languages it is written ordered set, in some other languages it is also known as binary search tree or you can say the tree set. So depending on whichever data structure you are implementing, whichever programming language you are using, you have to put this. you"

I wanted to switch to my career where I can, at least I can write some programs. Decided to go with the cryo because the motto of cryo is learn by doing. So I also observed that here everything we need to start from scratch, not like the code is given to you. During the program, I learned Java as well as defiance Java, where we basic data structure of Java and collection data structure as well. With the help of Java, teach us Selenium. With the help of data, we can do the web automation and for doing the unit testing, they teach us the test NG and JUnit. After doing this course, I get to know that the other way of writing code. This helped me to change my style of coding. I get to confident like, yeah, I can, if any problem is given to me, someone asked me to automate from. Then I can automate the cover of the latest technology. I will help in the prepare for the interview how to answer the question"

        "transcription": "Are you bored of watching a lot of videos on how to prepare for DSA? By the way, have any of these plans helped you overcome your fear of DSA interviews? What if I told you that there is a time-tested approach to learning DSA that has helped over a thousand learners crack their job interviews? And more importantly, it's a super easy plan to follow and practice for yourself. Are you ready to go through the plan and start working today? Hi, I'm Rithvik, and today I'm going to walk you through the three stages of learning data structures and algorithms. What areas to focus on each stage, and share the important topics to cover as you go from stage 1 to stage 3. Now, DSA is a hot topic when it comes to interviews. It is asked during in-person interviews and online assessments as well. So, how many problems do you need to solve to get ready for your interviews? A hundred? A thousand? as many problems as you can cover till the day of your interview? Well, here's how you can decide on the number of problems you need to solve. If you're a fresher or you're relatively new to the industry, 100 problems is all it takes to crack a job under 8 lakhs per annum. If you're aiming for 8 to 15 lakhs per annum, you'll need to solve about 250 problems. And if you're looking to land your dream job which pays above 15 lakhs per annum, you need to focus on more than 250 problems to make it through every round. Remember I told you about three stages? Each stage in this video is designed to incrementally take you towards your dream job. However, randomly solving the said number of problems is not going to help. Let's look at what you need to cover in each stage. And before we dive into the three stages, drop a comment and tell us which language you're going to use to practice the DSA problem. Stage 1. For this stage, you need to set aside around 150 hours for preparation. And the end goal of this stage is to write 20 to 30 lines of code without making too many mistakes. In this stage, you'll be doing a lot of syntax lookups on Google. which is absolutely fine. Don't get discouraged by the idea of googling things. In the end isn't that how we learn? With time the familiarity with the language will increase. Another thing is you're going to run into common errors and exceptions. For every piece of code you write you're likely to run into some errors like array index out of bound exception, missing return statement, name of some variable is not defined. So what's the best way to cross this stage? Spend time on Google to try and understand what the error exactly means and then make changes to the code. The biggest mistake that you can do here is making random changes to the code just for the sake of getting rid of the errors. Don't do that. Any language has a finite number of errors. Once you're familiar with the top 25 errors you'll be quite comfortable with the language and your coding speed will increase as well. The most important topic to practice in this stage are logic building, collections 101, space and time complexity, arrays which would include techniques like two pointers, sliding window, matrix, prefix sum and binary search. You will have to practice sorting, link list implementations and its operations, application of hash, stacks, and queues, and basic recursion. An excellent resource for this stage is Cracking the Coding Interview Book. Before we get to stage 2, let's look at the essentials you need to complete for stage 1. Do make sure to take a screenshot so that you can have all the topics in one place. Stage 2. Once you pass stage 1, you have won half the battle. Now you'll have enough confidence in yourself as a coder. Unlike the earlier stage, to get good at these problems, you'll have to go through multiple resources. A good start would be to solve top 100-150 commonly asked medium difficulty problems in LeetCode. Stage 2 is more about becoming good at cracking interviews rather than just being a good coder. You might ask, are they different? And the answer is a resounding yes. For you to be a good developer in a company, all you need are the development skills and the level of practice in stage 1. But to crack personal interviews where your expected CTC is above 8 lakhs, you need stage 2 and 3. approach stage 2 of your preparation. In this stage, improve your ability to think about multiple solutions for a given problem. Analyze the time and space complexity for the said solution and pick one which suits you the best. Focus on writing graph traversals for BFS and DFS in less than 10 minutes. Since you're familiar with the syntax and the common errors, you'll be able to resolve them quite quickly. Your coding and debugging skills would have improved considerably by the end of this stage. Overall, you should be able to reduce any problem to the functions you have already written in the past and solve them. Before you start solving your next 100 to 150 problem, it's important to set goals on the kind of problems you want to solve in this stage. Focus on these topics. Implementation of stack, queue, hash, BST and tree, application of BST, tree, heap and graph, breadth-first search and depth-first search. If you have made it till here, comment and let us know what you have been struggling with the most when it comes to learning DSA. If it's something we haven't covered yet, we could help you in the comment section. covered in this video, it'll make our day to know that this video helped you find your direction. Before moving on to the last and final stage, let's look at what you need to get past stage 2. Again, if you need to take a screenshot, please do that. Stage 3, now comes the final stage. Until now, you have solved about 250 problems. You're familiar with the common errors you might encounter and are capable of picking up the right solution to a problem. You're pretty much comfortable with data structures and algorithms at this stage. Now, all you have to do is practice. Increase your speed of coding and cracking interviews. For example, in stage 2, you solved a graph problem in 45 minutes. Would you believe me if I say that you'll be able to solve it in 20 minutes? You absolutely can, but there's a catch. Constant practice. Dedicate some time and focus on solving a wide variety of problems. This reduces the chance of you getting into an unfamiliar situation or question during the interview. One tip here is, look at the problem like a game, not like a chore. If you do this, you will start enjoying being challenged with new problems. With this mindset, you'll be motivated to solve new problems. problems. The topics you need to cover in this stage are DP memoization, DP tabulation, knapsack, advanced recursion and backtracking, greedy method, topological sort, graph partitioning, fanning tree, shortest path algorithm, try and segment tree. Now that you have understood how to go about the various stages, let's try to understand how to do deliberate practice to get the best out of your time. A simple yet effective way is to learn by reading good code before solving the problems yourself. You'll pick up on efficient tips and tricks that will help you further down the line. Here is a simple and effective approach to solving any problem, especially in stage one. Day one, take a problem and spend about 10 to 15 minutes to come up with a reasonable approach to solve the problem. Read through various ways of how others have solved this problem. Day two or later, try implementing the solution by yourself. An interesting thing to note here is that we are asking you to look at various solutions on day one and solve the problem independently on another day. Any guesses why? The reason behind this is that if you try to solve the problem on the same day as you go through the solution, you are more likely to reproduce the same answers which you have read already. Try this out and you'll be able to see the difference for yourself. Come back to the comment section and let us know the difference you saw in your solutions. Yes, the aim is to practice and practice a lot, but don't practice aimlessly. Set specific goals you want to achieve by the end of your practice. Let me walk you through three must-achieve goals you need to set for yourself before you begin your practicing journey. Be familiar with a lot of patterns of problem solving. Familiarity with the problems themselves. Example, linkless reversal, mirroring a BST, or count island have been asked for a time forever. No harm in having the ability to write the code quickly for these problems. Most importantly, repeatability. When you practice, ask yourself this question. If the same problem were asked next time in an interview setting, can you solve it in 30 to 40 minutes? This should give you an idea. If you endlessly debug to make the program work, then you will not be able to write it again with the similar pain. This is where cryos met helps you leaps and bounds. Break down a problem of any size into small pieces and focus on writing very small functions. When you approach this way repeatability becomes very easy. So how should you practice to achieve these goals? Be consistent. Two problems per day is ideal. Syntaxes come naturally with practice. Don't rack your brain if you can't remember a syntax. Look online immediately. Spend no more than 90 minutes on a problem. If you're stuck come back to it after a day. Improve your debugging skills. Find a partner you can buddy up with and practice every day. This helps sustain motivation and will keep you more consistent over a period of time. You can start by sharing this video with your buddy and ask them to join you on this journey. That brings us to the end of this video.

It's majorly waking up every day and having a new problem to solve, not knowing how to actually tackle it, being in that ambiguity and trying to resolve it, and at the end when you are able to solve that problem, that excitement that you have finally done it, that makes everything. I've been talking to a lot of software developers today, and that's what they've been telling me, that their job is awesome because they get to solve a different problem every day. Do you think that's a very important aspect of your job? Yeah, definitely, because if you are into monotonous things, it would be really bad. Most of the jobs I think are of those monotonous nature, and eventually you would get bored. But the fact that every day you would be challenged with something new, that gives you the motivation to actually get to it. Let me ask you a very cliche question. of your question, where do you see yourself in 5 years? Definitely I would want to be promoted to a place where I can actually lead a team to something which actually impacts the business and I can create more of an impact from user perspective. Currently my role is just to contribute to a code but eventually I would want to be in a place wherein my contribution or my leadership would help the business to create an impact on the users at the largest scale. That's amazing, I love that you are very focused on it and you already have a 5 year plan set. Alright, so this was the first ever CanConnect, can you tell us your experience here, did you enjoy it? Yeah definitely, the conversation that, the discussion that was there, it was really insightful, it was deep, these guys, the kind of discussion was really insightful, that gave me an understanding of what I should expect and how I should behave. plan my career so definitely that was interesting the stand-up comedy that was really it was actually my first kind of comedy so I liked it all right so before you go trick question I'm sure by now you know it what is the full form of Cryo alumni network that's right it's cryo alumni network thank you for coming please enjoy it thank you you"

Thanks a lot for joining on a Sunday morning. Right. My dear welcome to all students, our mentors, and most importantly, all the graduating batches of 2023. It's my real honor to be here today at this momentous occasion, the Cryo Hall of Fame 2023 award ceremony. First and foremost, I want to congratulate everyone for reaching this milestone of graduating and landing the dream job in the year of 2023. Right. Your journey is not just been a learning rigor, especially in the year of 2023. It's been a test of your resilience, adaptability, and perseverance. Each of you have joined us with a dream, and we're really fortunate to be part of your transformation journey in last year. The year 2023 generally has been a... challenging year for the tech world right a lot of companies not just in india across the globe faced challenging times the hiring has slowed down all of you right despite of all of that thrived in the face of challenging times and today we are celebrating not just your career outcomes but the strength of character shown by all of you so i can personally vouch for it right so uh i graduated in 2008 in the middle of subprime crisis i don't know a lot of you might be uh in your schools right uh i graduated in 2008 from my mba in march the next five months right i'm looking back those are my toughest days of my career every day i'll wake up go for a five kilometer run sit and apply 100 companies and prepare for four hours that is my routine for five five months right literally no company was hiring those five months right from uh starting march right when the market started opening up in three weeks i had four opportunities my hit ratio was 100 percentage i cracked four out of four looking back those are best days of my career uh which taught me some hard learnings and gave me real confidence to face any challenging kind of career situations ahead. I strongly believe the great companies as well as great careers are actually built in those challenging times. As all of you step into the world that is constantly evolving, there's a lot of talk about AI, how developers role is changing, how automation roles, QA roles are changing in the coming year, right? Remember that your learning does not end here. The most successful individuals are the ones who actually accept the fact that learning is a lifelong journey. As you must have realized, we believe that in cryo, right? We don't believe in teaching you specific full stack or a back end or a kind of automation technologies. We believe in teaching you how to learn and we believe in actually teaching you the philosophy of learn by doing, right? Hope all of you will carry this forward. I think looking ahead, I would say be adaptable, stay curious and embrace the changes and challenges coming ahead. I would say your ability to learn will be the only greatest asset you will carry this forward. And to those who are actually receiving the Hall of Fame awards today, all of you have set an benchmark of excellence, right? These awards are actually not just... recognition of your efforts, it's also testament to the potential each of you have in the coming years, right? Before we move on to kind of award section, I will also kind of share some insights for existing students, as well as all the alumni here, in terms of opportunities brought in by our career success team, despite of all the challenges in the market in the year of 2023, and also the outcomes achieved by all of you together. We look at opportunities in three buckets, right? This is kind of above 15 LPA bucket. Till last week, right, in the year of 2023, we have brought in 1,800 plus opportunities, and average CTC achieved by Cryo grads in this bucket of 15, greater than 15 LPA was 21 LPA, and max CTC achieved by Cryo grad was 45 LPA. Moving on, in the bucket of 18 to 15 LPA, we had 2,300 opportunities. The average CTC achieved by Cryo grads were 10 LPA, and max CTC achieved by Cryo grads of 15 LPA. Then the next bucket of kind of 4 to 8, we had 2,500 opportunities. where the average achieved by CryoGrad was 4.6 LPA and the max was 8 LPA. This is where a lot of people coming from different backgrounds, some of the first jobs were all mostly here. So this is in terms of opportunities. We are very, very proud about the fact that in this challenging markets, our teams are able to bring in kind of 6,000 plus opportunities, close to 600 companies throughout the year. All of this resulting in, we just move ahead. Overall, the number of offers cracked by CryoGrad in the year of 2023 was 586, out of which 15% offers came in for QA automation jobs and 85% offers came in for software development. One quick thing to note here is QA automation also was a relatively new program and we didn't have a lot of graduates available to place in 2023. Talking about timelines, almost 78%, close to 80% of the users got placed within six months of graduation. Almost 95% of the users got placed from nine months of graduation. We had definitely some challenges for this 50%. percent users who had potentially higher notice period right but i think we were persistent and they were persistent along with this we're able to land them opportunities moving on average salary hikes in the year of 2023 has taken a hit uh if you just look at 2021 and early part of 2022 these numbers are actually upwards of uh 90 percentage we even had a lot of scenarios that we're actually getting upwards 100 percentage hikes but 2023 across salary buckets the hikes actually varied between 50 percentage to 70 percentage i think it's a great outcome uh despite of having a challenging job market in 2023 uh overall across months right we had like close to 50 to 70 offers per month kind of run rate we were actually placing one third of our uh graduate pool which is in the placement pool kind of every every month that's kind of the rhythm we we got into overall we had 563 hiring part unique hiring partners uh hired with us for multiple roles multiple jds across the year almost 65 percent of the hiring partners are actually repeat once for us right because we believe in uh giving a good set of graduates for them and they keep coming back to us right so in 2023 we had close to 563 uh companies actually hired from our graduate pool. These are the top 10 GIC opportunities uh based on CTC offered right we had companies like Credit Suisse, Asisium, Decathlon, Kodak, Cisco, Adobe, Airtel, Amazon, Deloitte, Nestle, HSBC were actually offering the top 10 uh opportunities based on the CTC from GIC category. Moving on to the top 10 startup category we had companies like Phonepay, Swiggy, Licious, Cleartrip, Udan, Lending Card, Lambda Test, Carta Book, Redbus and Express Bees kind of offering uh the highest opportunities from the startup category. Yeah I think that's pretty much in terms of the uh overall like summary of our 2023. I think we'll just move on to uh specifically go through the awards uh part of the event right so I like to call upon Rachel to take this from here. Thank you everyone, thanks again for joining. Let's actually celebrate the achievers among us let's spend some time going through the stories from Rachel you"

When I got to know about SCRIOS program, I figured out that I could brush up the DSA concept and at the same time, get the experience of working in industry. It also had a job opportunity with it. So I decided to give it a shot. I was no experience in working with backend systems. Understanding the new code base was always challenging to me, and I was looking forward for more hand-on experiences. I learned a lot of new concepts, like creating your own features, fixing bugs, and unit testing as well. I personally liked the learn by doing concepts here. I improved a lot in terms of accuracy, writing high quality code. The program is worth a try. You would always learn something which you share, you to become a better developer.

        "transcription": "So yeah, it is definitely worth the investment that you make. I mean, just looking at the cost, I think instead of that, if you look at the value that they offer, I think it's beneficial. I'm Gauri, and I graduated in NMIT from Information Science and Engineering background. So when I was in sixth semester, we had this Java subject, and I was very much inclined towards the OOPS concept, and I wanted to get a thorough understanding of it. So I wanted to continue my journey in back-end development itself. I was looking for a course where I could, you know, upscale both my development and coding skills, and that's where I came across Cryo. And it was a very good platform, wherein I was able to be very consistent with all my assignments. And if I'm left to do alone, I don't think I would have been consistent enough with my efforts. Consistency is a key to achieve anything. The regular assessments or the take-home assessments, or be it the regular classes that... was conducted at Cryo. They were very helpful. The TAs were also very helpful in clearing the doubts. Coming to the projects, I was able to build a lot of mini projects which was very helpful and I was able to get a lot of hands-on experience and I was very confident while attending the interviews. Basically, there is a methodology to learn anything and the path which you follow is very important while achieving certain goal and that needs to be properly broken down into smaller segments which is easier to achieve. Also, the TAs were very helpful especially in the DSA streams. Whenever I got any doubt, whenever I was stuck, I used to make use of the chat system and my doubts were instantly cleared. Especially, there's one mentor by the name Prashant from Java backend and he was very helpful. He used to clear my doubts. I used to ask him a lot of questions and he was very patient enough to answer. Different people who are going to achieve the same goal as yours. and in a way that kind of gives you a feeling of community and you are always on the right track. So that is one thing."

Well, actually... Imagine you are in DMart waiting at the counter in a queue. The first one in the queue will be the first person to check out. Very simple system, right? Adding songs to a queue on Spotify works in a very similar manner. It is possible with the data structure also called queue. Now the Spotify may not use the queue data structure in its most basic form. But it uses the principles of the queue and adds more features to it. Now the queue data structure follows the first in first out principle. Let's say you add song A and song B to your queue. Now song A is the first one that you added to your queue and then B. Then song A will play first and is removed from the queue making way for the second song to play. So the songs that you add to a queue play in the same order in which you added them. This way Spotify ensures that you can listen to your favourites just the way you want. Gangnam Style!"

        "transcription": "Planning a software job can be quite tricky if you fall in one of these categories. You're not from tier 1 or 2 college, you have scored less than 60% marks, you have a gap in your education, you have backlogs, or you didn't get your first job yet even though you graduated 2 years ago. But what if I tell you that you could change this about your career and land a good paying software role? All you need is commitment and an actionable plan. Hey, I'm Rithvik and today we'll see how you could build your career in the software industry, regardless of your educational background. And if you're new to the channel, then hit the bell icon right away so that you don't miss any other videos we have planned for you in this career series. Consider this scenario, you're looking for serious career advice and there are three people sitting right in front of you. There's a person working in Facebook, there's a person working in Accenture, and there's a person working in Cisco. Now here's the catch, you have only 10 minutes to get your career advice, but you can talk to only- person. Who are you going to talk to and why? Let me guess, you talk to the person working in Facebook and not just you, chances are 99% of the people would do the same. Why? Because the interview process of Facebook is more rigid than Accenture and Cisco. You took that as a proxy and made the decision that they would be the smarter person to guide you. Did you take a minute to understand the background of the other two people? Who knows, the person working in Accenture might have built a five million dollar business or the person working in Cisco may have built a new routing algorithm. If I replace the three people with another set, your choices would have remained the same. That is, you didn't give any merit to the individual's talent but rather went for a proxy that was convenient to you. Now, say you had an entire day to socialize with each of them and then had to pick a person to get the advice from. Your decision may change as you had more time to understand their background better. Sadly, we don't have the luxury or time to go through with decisions this way and this is what exactly happens with recruiters. They get thousands of applications for a job but have to shortlist only 50. How do they do it? They focus on a few proxies in your resume like... knowledge, grades, and skills that match the job to filter out the suitable candidate. Similar to what you had done earlier, the people's company. Now that you have understood why it is slightly tougher for you to get more interview opportunities, let's see how you can bounce back and make the most of your situation. If you put your mind and soul towards your aim, in a mere 4-5 months, you can completely reset your career. There are 3 ingredients for a successful career. Preparation. For any type of job, you need to pick up the right set of skills. Opportunities to demonstrate those skills. And 3. This is entirely based on how you leverage your skills in the opportunity you get and grow your career. But what about your background? Your college, your grades, your education gap? Where do these come to play? In reality, your background only affects the number of opportunities you get. That's just 1 out of 3 parts of your successful career. Preparation and performance are still in your hands. Which is why the plan I am about to share with you is absolutely doable if you set your mind to it. But before we dive into how you can prepare and gain the necessary skills, let's look at how bad can it actually affect your job. prospects and what can you do to reduce its effects. Say you applied for 10 jobs, you might get shortlisted for 3 companies unlike people with good backgrounds who could get shortlisted for 8 jobs. That's the only shortcoming of your background. But this can be tackled. What do you think you can do to get more opportunities? 1. Improve your resume. 2. Apply to more companies. Yes, that's what we are going to do and let's see how. But before we go any further, first and foremost, let's put your past behind you. There's no point in fretting over bad grades or other situations which led to your current Unless maybe you are waiting for Elon Musk to build a time machine. Are you? But I don't think this is going to happen anytime soon. So let go of your past and focus on your future. What if I tell you, regardless of your past, you can change your career in the next mere 4-5 months? Are you ready? Hit that thumbs up and let's get started. For the first 15 days, spend some time learning a language. You can either learn Python or JavaScript. Use resources like FreeCodeCamp to get started. Take a goal of writing at least 50-100 programs in the language you have learned. Once this is done, focus on learning the basics of DSA for the next two months. Most companies have coding assessments as the first round of the hiring process. These rounds help them filter out the suitable candidate. So be sure to be prepared. If you don't know how to get started with your DSA prep, check out our DSA prep video that takes you through the three stages of learning DSA for interviews. I have added the link of the video in the description. And for your purpose, aim to complete the first stage in the video by the end of two months. The first two months of the preparation are the hardest. It is completely normal for you to feel nervous and it is a part of your learning journey. Have you ever heard of the three zones of learning? It's the safe zone, stretch zone and the strain zone. These zones are beautifully explained in a video by Udacity. It's when you have almost decided to give up, but continue to pursue your goal. That is when the real magic happens. I'm sharing the link to the video in the description. You can pause for a moment and come back after watching it. Once you get comfortable with the programming language and the basics of DSA, it is time for you to build two to three projects. When it comes to choosing projects, don't simply go after the hotshot topics like ML or IoT for your initial projects. Pick projects where you can spend time writing. amount of code. And it's okay to refer to someone's solution for inspiration but don't merely copy their code. There's no learning there. You can choose any project from Cryo projects hub. You'll find over 50 real-world projects in Python, Java, JavaScript and more. Best part is each project there comes with a guided plan to help you finish the project all by yourself. You'll find the link to the project hub in the description. The main goal of working on projects is to make your resume stand out with the hands-on skills companies are looking for. The moment they see your project work, your grades and college backgrounds becomes less important. And this is a proven way to move forward in your career regardless of your college background. So far we have covered what you need to include in your resume. That is practical skills and projects. But there's one more thing. You also have to craft a resume such that it highlights the important details. Spend a day or two preparing your resume to showcase your work in a clear and concise way. Run it by your friends and get feedback. If you need help with it, go through the tips shared in the software development resume guide. I'll add the link to the guide in the description. You'll get a good idea how to structure your resume and what to include to craft the perfect resume. If you're finding this video useful so far, let us know by liking the video. And let's continue with the rest of the plan. Once you've got your resume ready, the next step is to start applying for jobs and get interview ready. Prepare for commonly asked questions around databases and languages you picked up. You can visit sites like GeeksforGeeks and TutorialPoint to help you with your preparation. Take out at least two weeks to prepare for interviews. Some IT companies might have aptitude as part of their hiring process. Spend a week max to prepare for these tests. Beyond that, focus more on programming. And when you start applying for jobs, take a target of at least 25 job applications per week. Look for opportunities through LinkedIn, AngelCo, and your friends. Your end goal is to land your first job with at least 3.5 lakhs per annum package. While looking for jobs, you might find that a few of them have some eligibility criteria. Like Goldman Sachs, filter candidates based on their aggregate percentage. Or some IT companies ask for a minimum 60% during 10th, 12th, or graduation. Don't worry about these companies. There are thousands of other companies that are ready to hire you. Just have to find them. Also, remember, don't be afraid of rejections. Rejections are a part of your journey. At the end of the day, all you... need is one or two good job offers so apply to as many companies as you can to increase your chances of getting that job offer. Once you start applying for jobs, don't stop your learning there. Keep revisiting topics you haven't yet covered and continue to expand your knowledge. Revise data structures and algorithms and try to build more projects to improve your resume. It will help you maximize your chances of getting selected in job interviews. Find yourself a mentor if you can. Their guidance can help you stay on track and help you reach your goal in a less stressful way. Ask your cousins to help you or reach out to someone you know on LinkedIn asking them for guidance. Almost everyone would be willing to guide you through your prep. So here's a quick recap of the preparation plan. First 15 days, learn a language. Your end goal is to write 50 to 100 programs. For the next two months, focus on DSA. Solve at least 100 problems and if you need more guidance, watch the DSA prep video I've shared in the description. After that, take up projects. Build two to three projects on your own that would make your resume stand out. With these things checked off, your next step would be to craft a crisp and concise resume. Go through the resume guide shared in the description box for tips and best practices to prepare your resume. And at last, take a Take these 15 days to concentrate on commonly asked questions in interviews before you start applying for jobs. Apply to 25 or more companies every week and continue to prepare for your interviews till you land your first software job that pays you at least 3.5 lakhs per annum. In these 4-5 months, commit yourself to the process by giving at least 30-40 hours a week. The hustle during this time will go a long way in turning your life around. Congrats on making it to the end of the video. I'm sure you determined to get your first software job by following the plan I've shared with you. If you are placed in a software role, do come back and let us know in the comments. Nothing excites us more than knowing that this plan helped you with your career."

        "transcription": "In this video, we are going to understand about headings in HTML. And to understand the same, let us now go through one use case. So have a look on the snippet of this article. Well, what are the things that you're able to observe over here? Well, if you see the most important lines in this web page or this article is basically the contribution guide or the reporting bugs. So you're able to specify the heading in a bigger font size and you're able to bold it as well. Similarly, if you wanted to have a subheading like reporting bugs, you could show it in a comparatively smaller size, but that is a subheading kind of thing, right? And whatever is going to be your normal text, which is a part of your paragraphs are going to follow even more smaller font sizes. So how can you do these kind of formattings in your web pages is something we need to discuss. So headings in HTML are represented by a total of 6 tags starting from h1 till h6. So h1 being the biggest font size and h6 being the smallest font size. So wherever we wanted to give the major heading or the main heading, we went ahead with the h1 tag. Similarly, we wanted to give a smaller subheading, we went ahead with the h2 tag convention and so on and so on. Now under reporting bugs, if we wanted to have more subheadings, we could use an h3. For an example, how do I submit a good bug report? Now this is a subheading of the reporting bugs topic. So this is how you can keep on following the conventions of using headings and subheadings with the help of h1 till h6 tags. So we have a total of 6 such tags. We're going to see its demo as well. As I've told you, h1 is going to give us the biggest heading. and h6 is going to give you the smallest heading. When I say the biggest and smallest, it is in terms of the font sizes as well as their font weights. Now, how exactly does this work? Now, headings are going to help in emphasizing a section of text on a page. So it can be separated by emphasis using different heading sizes. For a heading, you go ahead with the h1. For a subheading, you go ahead with the h2. Under the headings, you can have an h3 and so on and so on. So largest heading is going to be the most important section or maybe it can contain the major title of your article or whatever webpage you're exactly trying to build up. What is going to be the smallest heading? It's going to be the least important section, probably the lowest level of hierarchy or whichever is the least important section you want to discuss through your subheadings is can be considered in the h6 tag. Now, HTML headings can be created with h tags. So starting from h1 till h6. So. H1 is going to be the largest and most important heading from our conventions and H6 is going to be the smallest and least important heading according to the normal conventions that we follow. So let us go to code sandbox and try to understand this with the help of an example. So we do have a HTML template available on code sandbox. So let us visit that part. So if you can see, we have an already prepared HTML template. Now under the body tag, I can start writing my headings. So let us write each of those headings to understand how exactly do they look. So let me first write H1. This is a heading and I'll just close the H1 tag. I'll also write it for all the others. So let me just get started with an H2. I can say this is a smaller heading H2 and the same thing I can do for the remaining four. lines as well. So I'll just keep on changing the text over here probably. This will be in H3. This becomes in H4. Let's give the next two as H5 and the last one as H6. If I save this file, let's see how exactly does the output look. And as you can see, H1 is giving us the biggest set of heading and it is going on smaller and smaller according to whatever tags you have given over here. So in a summarized way, HTML headings can be written in a total of six tags starting from H1 till H6. Depending on the importance you want to give to a heading, you can appropriately decide what is going to be the tag which is to be most suitable for your use case. So this is exactly how the HTML headings work. you"

Mentors were very supportive and helpful. They were not giving the straightforward answers. I should figure out the problem. Their knowledge were very insightful. Their industry knowledge, like how things work internally, how should we cope up with the current market trends. We should constantly be updated with the knowledge.

I think one company that does this really well, an example is Udaan, in their interviewing stage, they have coding round, of course, where you have to showcase your coding acumen, but then they don't stop there. You also have an engineering manager round, or an engineering management focused round where you talk about system design and how this new feature is coming up and all these things are there, how you approach it, what's the best way. And as a growing company, requirements can change, so the decisions you make should support your growth as well.

        "transcription": "I did intern in a few companies, but when I went into full-time employment, that is when I understood that there was some gap between what I was trying to do and what I learned from college. So, Cryo was something which helped me bridge that gap. We were taught basic programming in college, but using frameworks and trying to develop using frameworks were important, which was very essential for us. So, unlike the other projects where we just go and build something, the projects at Cryo were aimed at the projects which would be useful for you in real life scenarios. When I'm working with my current company as well, there are a lot of things where I see in my current company that I've learned at Cryo, like the way of building something, the way of designing something before going in front of coding. So, I see a lot of things in my current company which go online with what I'm learning at Cryo, that has helped me and also made me understand things a lot better. If you ask me right now on where I am, I would say I'm in a very better position to where I was when I joined BigFour. I now have a complete understanding on how things go on in the back. I might not be an expert in everything, but I have a sense of what's going on at the back end. At the part where I contribute, I'm very confident I'm doing the part right now. After Gravy, I've understood that there are a lot of other things that matter the most. It's not only getting the answer, but it's also getting the optimal answer that's important with big companies. And that's something which I learnt on the go when I was doing it. This way of learning was very new to me at the start. Because most of the learning which I did was through college or through YouTube, where I used to watch a video and then basically try and code what was there. But this was something different and this is something which will also be something in the real world. Learn by Doing way was actually very helpful for me to understand concepts a bit deeper. You can follow the bootcamp tutorial as well, but when you're trying to do it. it on your own, when you're trying to work on your own with Googling stuff. It was a bit tough for me at start to understand things, but, uh, that's something that I also learned and become a better programmer at times where I was stuck, uh, there were a lot of people from Kayo who were ready to offer me help. So they monitor your PQ progress. And if at some time they find that you're stuck at a point, they'll come and ask you that if you're stuck at some point and they'll give you inputs on why you need to improve and what you need to do. Cryo has this specific track on teaching you DSA and algorithms for, for a few weeks, and that has really helped me to learn and understand few DSA concepts which I wasn't clear before. The projects which I built in Cryo were very essential for me, although overall it was very helpful for me in tracking the internals. One thing I would say for sure is, uh, there are a lot of ways of doing reaching a solution, but there are a few things which you need to keep in mind. for starting off. You need to understand the problem properly first and then you have to kind of systematically proceed on trying to solve the problem. Something which Cryo taught me and if you're starting something on your own, you wouldn't have the idea of where to start off with on how to proceed with. You will not know a definite path on where to follow. But with the help of Cryo, what you can do is you can understand the requirements that's been had. You will know what you need to do and how you need to do and the process would definitely help you in understanding the problem and solving the problem in a lot of efficient manner. If you understand why you're doing everything then that would help you become a better programmer in the future also."

        "transcription": "In this video, let us now try to learn about HTML attributes and to understand the same, let us now go through one use case. Now in the ordered list, instead of numbers like 1, 2, 3, you want a different set of ordered list. Let us say you want it in Roman numbers like this kind of a system or you want an alphabetical ordering. Now how exactly we are going to make use of that? So for that, we have HTML attributes. Now attributes are going to provide us some additional information about the elements. So let us say instead of directly numbering it as a 1, 2 or 3, I want to number it in alphabetical system. I want to order it in alphabetical system, so it will always be specified in the starting tag itself and attributes are usually going to come in a name value pair. Like let us say I want to give name equals to value kind of an attribute to a tag. So how exactly we are going to make use of it? Let us try to understand that with the help of this example. We have an HTML tag. Now this is the opening tag, right? To which I'm giving a lang attribute. Now this lang attribute stands for language. So this is the name of the attribute and this is the value of the attribute, right? So we can provide some additional information to the elements which are known as attributes. So if we see for this ordered list, when we are trying to print it, it was coming as one coffee, two tea and then three milk. If I don't want a numbering system and instead I want some other kind of a system, I can say something like this. I can pass type equals to capital I. Now this will change it to the Roman numbering system. Let us try to see the same on code sandbox. So let us visit code sandbox and try to implement something similar. So, over here, if I now try to create an ordered list with the help of ol tag, I can be giving a type attribute to it and let me give it a capital I. Now, if I try to list down some items over here with the help of li tags, let us see what is going to be the output this time. Let's say coffee, let's say milk, let's say juice. If I now try to print it, you can see it's a Roman numbering system this time. Similarly, I could have changed this to a capital E. Now this is going to do it in an alphabetical order now. So you can simply specify the type attribute to the ol tag so that accordingly the numbering or the ordering can be done. So this is how attributes can be used in general. Thanks for playing.

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video, we will be discussing the problem find if there are two elements in a sorted array that add up to a given target. So first what we will do we will discuss the problem statement in the first milestone then we will go towards the problem approaches which we can do to solve it and then we will find out the most optimal approach or the one of the optimal approach to code it actually first write the pseudocode that is instruction manual and then actually code it in the next video. So starting with the first milestone itself that is reading the problem statement understanding the sample input and output. We are given a sorted array of integers specifically in this question it is mentioned we are given a sorted array. So we have to assume it is sorted a sorted array of integers and a target value as input given these two inputs what we have to do we have to find if there is a pair of elements that add up to a given target that is two elements in the array whose sum will be equal to the target return true if such a pair exists or you can say it is found otherwise false if it is not found. So a very simple problem statement self-explanatory, but still let's take an example input to actually completely understand it. Let's say there are five elements in the array the number of elements is five. Let's say the five values in the array are 2, 4, 5, 8, 9 as you can clearly see the array is sorted it should be sorted and the target value which is given in the input is 7 is there any pair with value 7 in the array and I can say yes it is 2 plus 5 will be 7 that's why 0th index plus second index that is having value 2 and 5 will be adding up to given target that's why return true or you can say output is present although we have to return true or false but what will happen if the target is not present let's say if I give you target as 100 in the same example there is no pair with the target 100 there is no two elements whose sum is equal to 100 so return false in that case so I think problem statement is clear to everyone constraints as you can see clearly is the array dot length will be 10 raised to power 5 and the value of each of the element present in the array will be at max 10 raised to power 6 and every value will be positive so what we have to do in order to solve it any brute force approach which comes to our mind see if I take the array let's take 2 let's take 4 let's take 5 let's take 8 let's take 9 let's take the same array which is given in the input and let's take the target as 9 is there any pair with target 9 how do we figure out it we can say since we need a pair since we need two elements run a loop for the first element then run a loop for the second element and since we need all such elements for a comma b we will run a nested loop so a nested loop where first element will be figured out in the first loop second element will be figured out in the second loop so if let's say the first element is figured out using outer loop that is pointed by left pointer inner loop will be let's say right pointer so is it 2 plus 4 equal to 9 no is it 2 plus 5 equal to 9 no it's 2 plus 8 equal to 9 no is it 2 plus 9 equal to 9 no then what we have to do then let's take the left element as 4 that is first index can I start the right pointer at the same index in the quotient it is nowhere mentioned that we cannot take the same element twice although we have to assume something whether we can take the same value twice or not so for now what we are doing is we are assuming that we are not going to take the same index twice the two elements should be distinct although it should be mentioned somewhere but as part of a quotient if the assumption will go wrong then we will get a wrong output but the assumption for now is that the two elements should be having different indices all the values can be same but indices should be different so is a 4 plus 4 equal to 9 no actually we do not have to check 4 plus 4 why because we cannot take the same indices is 4 plus 5 equal to 9 yes and as soon as we are able to figure out it we will return but what will be the worst case time complexity of nested loop as you can clearly see that one loop for one element another nested loop for another element n into n worst case it will go n square although it is not exactly n square but it will be n into n plus 1 by 2 1 plus 2 plus 3 up till up till n still it will be quadratic in nature only what about space since we will not require any extra space we will take constant amount of time in constant amount of you can say complexity in the space that is only two pointers only you can say 4 bytes 4 bytes in total 8 bytes but the question is can we do better this is a brute force approach but can we do better than the brute force and the answer is yes we can actually do better how we can do better we can use the property that the array is sorted we have nowhere used that property in the nested approach in the brute force approach but if we are assuming the array is sorted which is given in the quotient then what we can do we can actually apply a pointer two pointer actually logic a two pointer technique now what is a two pointer technique we will say that instead of running the both loops from left to right order first loop also from 0 to index to last index second loop also from left plus 1 till right index or n minus 1 index let's run the first loop or you can say let's run the first pointer from left to right only but what about the another pointer from right to left in that case we will be able to use the sorted nature property but how what is the current sum 2 plus 9 is it equal to target no it is 11 it is greater than target what should we do in order to make the sum target we have to go to 9 in order to go to 9 what should we do with 11 we have to decrease it decreasing it by 2 that is subtracting 2 will make it go to 9 what should I do to make it go to 9 decrease it but how can I decrease it should I make the 2 replace with 4 or 5 or 8 no it will actually increase the sum it will become 4 plus 9 instead of 2 plus 9 or 5 plus 9 or 8 plus 9 versus if you will replace 9 that is 2 plus 4 it might be the sum 2 plus 5 might be the sum 2 plus 8 it might be the sum it is decreasing the sum so we will replace the value which is at the right pointer which is having higher value so if the sum is higher replace the higher value or discard the higher value how can I discard the higher value now what is the next highest value possible it is just as the previous index it is just at the right minus 1th index so I can do what if the current sum is more than what we need we will do right pointer minus minus again ask 2 plus 8 again it is higher 2 plus 8 is 10 we need 9 we need 1 lesser sum so again in order to decrease the sum we will discard the highest value that is discard the value 8 and try to figure out the new pair which is 2 comma 5 so I will again do right minus minus minus but now if you will ask what is 2 plus 5 2 plus 5 is only 7 and 7 is what not what we need 7 is actually less than 9 we need a increased sum and in order to increase the sum we need to basically discard the left value or the right value if I will discard right value I will decrease the sum 2 plus 4 but I will if I will discard the left value I will increase the sum I will make it 4 plus 5 so discard the smallest value from the array that is do the left pointer plus plus because smallest value discard means left pointer will go to the right side so in this case we are doing left pointer plus plus and now as soon as I will see that 4 plus 5 is it equal to the target 9 yes it is so found the target found return true what will happen if let's say target was not 9 target was maybe 8 so in this case 11 was greater than 8 10 was greater than 8 7 was less than 8 9 is also going to become what 9 is also going to become 4 plus 5 will be 9 9 is also going to become more than 8 in order to decrease the sum I will do what I will say right pointer minus minus if target is 8 right pointer minus minus but as soon as I will make the right pointer minus minus what will happen left pointer and right pointer will go to the same index and according to the assumption which we have made we cannot take the same index twice we have to take different indices to add up to a given target so as soon as the left and right pointer becomes equal or even if you can say left pointer becomes more than right pointer then we have to stop so till when should we run the loop till when should we run the logic only till the point left pointer is smaller than right pointer only till that point so I hope the logic is clear what will be the time complexity as we are only running a left pointer from left to right right pointer from right to left in a single loop for overall the entire array length it will be order of n time complexity linear time complexity and what about space since we are again not going to take any extra data structure the space will be constant in a nature constant space no extra space is required in place solution so that was the logic of two pointers and the most optimized solution actually so with that we are going to write the instruction manual for the same problem what we are going to do initialize two pointers in this problem already the array sorted so let's directly initialize two integers which are left as a zero and right as what as n minus one left index k is what k is a target value actually so what we need to do we need to run a loop run a loop only till the point left is smaller than right why because as soon as the left becomes equal to right or more than right there is no more pair left first we have to take the sum as what as the value at left plus value at right array of left plus area of right it can be three possible scenarios with whether the sum is equal to target that is equal to k whether the sum is smaller than target or whether the sum is greater than target so sum is equal to target that is the first case if sum is greater than k that is second case and obviously last case will be else now what we have to do for the sum equal to k we can say since target is found what do we need to do return true that found the target is found the pair is found if the sum is more we need to decrease the sum or I can decrease the sum by making the largest value discarded how can I discard that largest value by making right pointer go to the left hand side that is make the sum smaller by making right minus minus and obviously in the other way around if we have to increase the sum discard the smallest value how can I decrease the smallest value discard the smallest value by making right pointer shift to the next element that is left plus plus but if this loop runs entirely and we are not able to return true at any point that is no pair found what should we do according to the question we have to return true or false whether target is found or not so I will say return false so this is the pseudocode in milestone number three with that we have completed the instruction manual"

So OYO was good, but I wanted something better. In the initial phase, especially you're learning work as well. And along with that, preparing for interviews for better opportunities, right? It's very hard to balance the two. Plus it's much easier if there's someone to guide you, right? So one of my seniors actually suggested me Cryo. So he told me that it helps you in your work as well as for looking in further opportunities. And it was very different from all the other programs and courses I'd heard of. It was a lot more holistic as well as it was very personalized. Before Cryo, I had worked hard, you know, I was a good coder before too. But the problem was that I was focusing on, okay, I have solved a hundred problems. Okay. I would be really good. That's not how it works.

Their package growth was very good, their career growth was very good. After seeing all this, I felt that my career growth should at least be linearly increased. I am going to do it. My degree is in civil engineering and I graduated in 2017. After that, I did a job as a highway engineer. I didn't see any opportunities for career growth there. I thought that I will prepare for the government, and then I did whatever I could, and I got the prelims for two exams, one for RRB JEE and one for SSE JEE. But I couldn't get the finals. Then I thought that my age was also increasing, I am 30 years old now. I felt that waiting for and preparing for government exam is not being worth for me, because my age is being running. My friends who graduated with me, So, back in 2017, he got selected through his career placement in college. In 2022, his package growth was very good, his career growth was very good. So, after seeing all this, I felt that I should also go in a field where my career growth is at least linearly increased. I came to know that I need automation and I developed my interest in automation. I talked to my friends about his curriculum and they also said that it's the best place to start my journey. There is a way to teach cryo, like they deliver things. So, I was highly motivated. The special skill that I learned was coding. I had not practiced coding in college. The terminologies were Java, OOPS. So, at that time, I did not know anything about it. So, while living here, they taught me coding very well. The articles and websites they provided were very helpful for me. to learn coding. So I learned to work here in a collaborative way. The projects I have done were very tough. In that, your learning will also be very good because until you pass the assessment, you cannot enter into another sprint or another milestone. You have to do it yourself. And when you put your mind to it, you learn a lot. And all the mentors were good, all the mentors were supportive. Even if there was any doubt, I used to ask them. I would call it a magical feeling. With my experience, I would say"

        "transcription": "Now, we will try to understand the concept around arrays. But before that, let's take a real-world example and then we will try to understand this. Let's say you're shopping on Amazon. In Amazon, will you add only one product to your cart or will you add multiple products? Pause the video and think through it. It will allow you to add multiple products. Okay, now let's say you are designing an application similar to Amazon and on the cart page, when someone clicks on the cart page, you only want to show, we don't want to have a vast application where we show the product name, price, total order summary and all, we don't want that. On the cart page, I only want to display the product names. Only display the product names, whatever we are added to the cart. Just think through it. How will you achieve that? How will you achieve that? Yes, so maybe we can say that. Okay, let's say we have three product in our card. So we will create three variables product one is equal to let's say toothbrush. Product two is equal to pen. Let's say these are your three products. So we'll store in three different variables. That's what we can say, right? Product three is equal to paper. Like this we can create three variables. If you have three products in our card, but think of a real-world scenario. On Amazon, you can order hundreds of product in one go. Yes. So will you create hundred different variables like this? Is that the feasible scenario? Is that the feasible solution? No, that is not the correct solution. to it. You should not create hundred different variables. So now let's try to understand what should be the solution over here. We have understood the problem statement that if you have to store hundred variables, you cannot go ahead and create that. There should be some mechanism. Some mechanism where you should be allowed to store all the hundred products in one variable. For example, something like this. Yes, that will be easier right? I can store hundred of products in one go. This was the easy solution. So let's try to understand how to achieve this in Java. For that we will make use of whiteboard to understand the problem statement. So let's see you are given a continuous memory location like this. Let's say this is your continuous memory location and your reference variable is pointing over here your products different variable. Products is basically a reference variable which is pointing to this memory location. Now you can store toothbrush in first location. Then I can store pen in second location. Then similarly, I'll store paper in third location. If I want I can store 100 of products right over here only and with the help of one reference variable, I'll be able to access that. Yes. Yeah, so this particular approach. in Java is known as a race. This is nothing but your areas you can store hundred of products over here and only one reference variable will be pointing to it. So let's say in your products array you want to store n elements total of n elements. What will happen in this case your positioning will start from 0 I want to store n elements my size is n but my position will start from 0 0 1 2 and the very last position will be n minus 1 I'll repeat myself so your product size is equal to 9 that is I want to store n elements if you want to store n elements or let it be simpler you want to store 5 elements if you want to store 5 elements your position will be from 0 to 4 your first position will be 0 1 2 3 4 so your position will be. n-1 always last index will be n-1 now one more thing. What is the data type of toothbrush string? What is the data type of pen and paper string? So you can store element of only one data type. You cannot mix match data type. I cannot store an integer over here. No, that is not allowed. You can store data of only one data type. That's all about the arrays. Now, let's try to code this. Let's say this is your array. Now in this entire area have stored only integers. So you should be allowed now. Can you mix match data type? Can you have integer boolean strings everything? No, you are not allowed to have that. Your index will always be start from 0 and it's a it will be n-1 first index. First position. So if you want to retrieve if your array name is my array and you want to retrieve element at 0th index, right? If you want to retrieve element at 0th index, you will write my array of 0. So basically your output will be a if you will write my area of 0 your output will be a it will give you the first element. Let's try to code that same thing so that we are much more clear now. Ok, so we have already seen that we had products, right? We will make use of the same example products example. The code basic skeleton is already provided in ArrayDraw Java. We will use use that same skeleton. So your products each one has a data type of a string. Yes, since they are string data type, you will declare your array of string type that is I should be allowed to store only string elements over here. Now this particular square symbol right the opening and closing of square bracket. It denotes that you are creating an array. So basically this entire thing the one I've highlighted this entire syntax means create me an array of strings that is I should be allowed to store string elements in that. Similarly, if you want to store integer element, you will store create array of integer type. Let's say numbers is equal to new int. Now you will have another square bracket over here which signifies the size. So if you will type 4 that basically means the size of array is 4 at most you should be allowed to store only 4 element. That's all now in order to retrieve a position right in our example in the whiteboard. We saw that index will be 0 1 2 3 4. So in order to store the element at 0th index, I will say that jute bag. So jute bag will be basically stored at first index 0th index. In in our example, we saw that that toothbrush was stored at 0th index or let me make it simpler. I'll store toothbrush only at first index so that we are able to recall with the example toothbrush now at very first index. We have stored pen then overhead paper. Now, let's see at the last position that is the fourth index. I want to store element. So I will write order items is equal to Let's say pencil. So basically pencil will be stored at last index third index since size is equal to 4 my index range will be 0 to 3. So this is how the elements are stored. Now, if you want to print some element your array name is order items. So from either items, I will try to get 0 so it should give me zeroth element similarly. I want the last element so I will type order items of 3. Let's run this and validate. Yes, we are able to get the first item and last item. Now, let's do one more activity where we will try to print the size. So in order to print the size. In order to print the size what should be my size for right at Max I can store for a limit. So my size has to be full. So in Java they have given you dot length. Dot length. So order items dot length if you will type order items dot length it will give you the size. So it should be ideally for let's run this and validate. So we are able to get a size of 4 now tell me one more thing over here. I want all of you to think through it and then you can pause the video if over here we have given the last index directly as 3 is there any mechanism by which I can make use of this order items dot length to get the last index. Yes, so let's try to figure it out together. Let me create a variable in last index. Can I say this last index will be order items dot length minus 1 it will be always order items dot length minus 1. Yes. Why it will be length minus 1 because it will be always n minus 1 Last position is always n minus 1. So it will be order items dot length minus 1. So this last index has to be order items dot length minus 1. Let's run this and validate. So we are still able to get size of 4 last item is your pencil as we predicted. This completes our basic discussion. the concept of arrays. Thank you all."

        "transcription": "Okay, so welcome back and in this particular video we will be discussing the problem rotate image by 90 degrees. So the problem is asking that we are given a n cross n 2d matrix representing an image. So we are given a square matrix when we say that we are given n cross n that is number of rows number of columns will be same in such a matrix which is representing an image we have to rotate it by 90 degree in clockwise direction. So we have to rotate the matrix in clockwise direction by 90 degrees. So if we basically read the sample input and output what is given in the sample input if there are three rows three columns n is 3 then the matrix if let's suppose it is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 rows 3 columns 9 elements after rotation by 90 degree the element should become 7 4 1 8 5 2 9 6 3. Similarly for a 4 cross 4 matrix, if this is the input matrix, this should be the output matrix. So, input matrix can be anything from 1 to 100, that is number of rows can be anything from 1 up till up till 100 and the matrix will actually have 1 up till up till 10 raised to power 4 number of elements. So if we read the remaining problem statement, we have to rotate the image in place, it means we have to modify the matrix directly in place means we do not have to create a new matrix, we have to do the changes in the same matrix itself, which is given in the input actually, that is there will be no return type, there is no expected output return type, we do not have to allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation. So this is given in the note. So input format will obviously be a n number of lines at layer plus 1, first line will be the n that is number of rows, number of columns, square matrix and then each row having some number. of elements the column number of elements that is n number of elements. So if I take the same example that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 what is the output for this corresponding matrix the output after rotation is nothing but 7 4 1 8 5 2 7 4 1 8 5 2 and then we can say it is 9 6 3 9 6 3. So if this is R0 R1 R2 C0 C1 C2 of input then this is R0 R1 R2 C0 C1 C2 of output and what is this this is rotation by 90 degree in clockwise direction. So is there any observation is there any relation between the input and output matrix. See if we think in terms of the row 1 2 3 so where are the elements 1 2 3 in the output the elements 1 2 3. in the output are in the column c2 the row 0 are now becoming column c2 row r1 is now becoming column c1 and similarly row r2 7 8 9 is now becoming column 7 8 9 so the elements which were in a given row they are in the output in the same column and if it is such a thing then what is the observation we have to actually make the row elements become column column elements become row so one of the approaches at least a brute force approach if it was allowed to change the matrix can we just create a new matrix and do the traversal column by column that is first it traverse for 1 2 3 and store all the elements in the last column then traverse the next row and store all the elements in the previous column then traverse the next row and store all the elements in the previous column if we are allowed to create a new matrix then we can just in the input matrix traverse row by row in the output matrix store column by column but since the extra matrix is not allowed to be created we have to do it in place currently the brute force will not work we have to discuss some optimization but time complexity since we are going to do a simple traversal on both the matrix it will be order of n square where n is the number of rows or number of columns and space will be order of n square again because we are going to create a new matrix so is there any better way in which we can not take any extra matrix and solve the same problem see if we have to make the elements add row become the element add column similarly for next row similarly for next row first thing what we can think of in terms of matrix is when rows become columns columns become rows this is nothing but making the transpose of a matrix or doing a transpose over a matrix what is a transpose element at a row comma column will become a element at a column comma row so for the same matrix if I just write the transpose for this input matrix if I write the transpose what will happen the element at I comma J will become the element at J comma I so what will be the transpose matrix so if I just show the matrix after the transpose the columns will be C 0 C 1 C 2 rows will be R 0 R 1 R 2 but what about 1 R 0 C 0 after transpose it will still remain R 0 C 0 so it will still remain here only but the element at R 0 C 1 will go at the place of element R 1 comma C 0 0 comma 1 will go at 1 comma 0 and same for 1 comma 0 will go at 0 comma 1 that is actually these two elements will get swapped that is 4 will come here 2 will go there similarly what about 3 the element at 0 comma 2 will actually get swapped with the element at 2 comma 0 0 comma 2 with 2 comma 0 I comma J with J comma I that is after swapping the element here will be 3 here will be 7 what about 5 this is 1,1 row is same column is same i,j is a i,i is 1,1 only so 1,1 getting swapped with 1,1 no problem like no swapping at all same goes for 9 also but finally we should also be swapping for 6 and 8 that is 8 will take the place of 6 6 will take the place of 8 why because 1,2 will take the place of 2,1 but is this what we need is this the output which we require if we compare this intermediate matrix with the output matrix we are still not to the target we are still not covering the entire problem statement we are not able to convert the input directly into the output this was your input this is your transpose matrix which is swapping the values at r,c with the values at c,r but now this matrix can be easily converted into the resultant matrix by again a similar observation what is the next observation see if we think in terms of rows now 1 4 7 in the output is a 7 4 1 2 5 6 in the output is 8 5 2 actually this is most probably this was 8 only I have not swapped so this is 8 this is 6 now if we compare is correct 1 4 7 1 4 7 from right side or you can say 1 4 7 7 4 1 2 5 8 8 5 2 3 6 9 9 6 3 that is each row is getting reversed each row is getting reversed and if each row is getting reversed we can after the reversal of each row say that finally after these two steps involved we are able to convert the input matrix into the output matrix but the point is we are going to apply these two steps in how in which kind of manner so that it is in place so that it is not taking any extra space see if we know how to reverse a 1d array then it is also easy to reverse a row of a given matrix because a row of a given matrix can be taken as a 1d array with some particular index that is what we used to do in reversing a single array we used to take array of left and array of right and used to swap the left value with the right value but this time what i will do or what we will do we will say matrix of a given row and the left column will get swapped with matrix of a given row with the right column so the given row can be zeroth row that is zeroth row comma zeroth column with zeroth row comma second column getting swapped then row plus plus for the left actually column plus plus for the left column minus minus for the right so as soon as they meet we will stop same goes for the next row same goes for the next row so for each row we are about to reverse each and every row using a two-pointer technique so we know how to reverse a row of a given matrix how to reverse using two-pointer but how to do transpose. Transpose is a relatively new term see if I am going to run a loop on entire matrix and if I am going to swap R, C with C, R we already know how to swap two elements by using a temporary variable but if I will swap one with one no problem you can do it two with four okay four and two swapped three with seven okay well and good but should I again swap two and four should I again swap one comma zero with zero comma one no if these two elements are swapped two times they will become the same array no two elements no two pairs no two elements in a single pair should be swapped two times otherwise it will give you the same matrix so how can I prevent two swapped with four and again four swapped with two how can I prevent two times swapping we can just only say that upper half of the matrix will get swapped with the lower half that is all the elements which are above the diagonal. will get swapped with the elements below the diagonal that is 2 will get swapped with 4 but 4 will not get swapped with 2 that is you can say 0,1 we will run a loop but we will not run a loop for 1,0 we will only run a loop in the outer upper right triangle that is 1 getting swapped with 1, 2 getting swapped with 4, 3 getting swapped with 7, 5 getting swapped with 5 itself, 6 getting swapped with 8, 9 getting swapped with itself and that's it no need to run the loop over 4, 7 and 8 respective indices because if we are going to run it then it will actually do 2 swapping so 2 steps overall first step to run a loop on the half of the matrix that is upper right triangle and swap R, C with C, R in order to make the columns become row become column just on the basis of observation as soon as we are able to do it this is not the required matrix to make the intermediate matrix convert into the required matrix. that is rotated matrix what we need to do we need to reverse each and every column you can also think in terms of that we have to swap the columns that is make c0 become c2 make c2 become c0 but thinking in terms of reversing a single row will be easier so second step will be run a loop on every row and reverse it using a two pointer technique what will be the time complexity to do a transpose since we are going to run a loop on upper half triangle it will be order of n square because almost upper half will have n into n plus one by two a number of elements in worst case so it will be order of n square what about the reversing each and every row since i am going to run a loop on every row and reverse it running a loop on every row n reversing a given row using two pointer again n so n into n this will also go in square but will the time complexity be n square into n square or plus n square it will be plus because first we are applying this then we are applying this both are steps one after the other not one after the other inside another it is not nested first we will do the transpose once it is done once we are getting the intermediate on the intermediate matrix we will be applying the reversing of each row so overall time complexity will be quadratic in nature what about space are we going to use any extra space actually no we are doing it in place we are just changing the same matrix itself which we are getting in the input so let's quickly now basically go through the third milestone with that we have actually covered the second milestone that is coming up coming up with the approach so third milestone is going and writing the instruction manual so in the instruction manual first of all in the rotate image function what we need to do we need to do two steps step number one transpose the matrix by calling a function most probably we should have a separate functions for both the steps call the function transpose where I will pass the matrix and the expected output is not the output actually but expected logic is it will make all the rows columns column becomes rows so call the function transpose bypassing the matrix bypassing the matrix then step number two will be all the function which is nothing but reverse each row reverse each row bypassing the matrix again so both functions will be taking the matrix input but not returning anything because return type is what we have to do in in place so public void first of all transpose we have to create in which we are going to pass the matrix and the expected from expected code is that we have to run a loop in the upper right triangle that is for all elements where row should be lesser than equal to column that is if row is zero column can be zero one two if row is one column can be one or two if row is two column can be two so column should be greater than equal to row so i will be running a loop for all the rows that is for int row is equal to zero till the last row so actually we have to write the pseudo code so what we have to do is run a loop over all rows over all rows starting from 0 starting from 0 till the last row so how can you get the last row in particular to some languages where you are not getting the input as the number of rows you can just calculate matrix dot length or you can also calculate matrix of 0 dot length depending on if it is a square matrix or a rectangular matrix if it is square you can use both rows and columns as matrix dot length itself so first of all we are basically running a loop on over all rows then run a loop over columns from the row column from the row column till the last column till the last column and now swap the values swap the values present at row comma column with column comma row that is make the column become row make the row become column this is the first function. You can use the inbuilt swap logic for swap it is up to you how you can write it and then the second function will be to basically reverse each row. So for reversing each row we have created a function reverse rows where again we will be expecting our input in matrix and for this first of all we have to run a loop over all the rows. So run a loop over all rows starting from zero till the last row and now once we have fixed a row by using row pointer now we will run a two-pointer technique run a two-pointer technique over the columns that is left as zero right as the last column and using these two pointers we are going to reverse the basically that particular column. So how we can reverse a particular column or how we can actually reverse a particular row by swapping the elements we can say swap the values present at the current row comma left column with current row comma right column because the row will be same only the column will be left and right because we have to apply the two pointer on the column left column right column row will be same because it is treated as a one day array after swapping what we used to do in two pointer we used to do left increment by one left should be increment by one but right should be decrement by one but right will be decremented by one and finally we are able to basically reverse each row also and with that we will be able to do the entire logic so run a two pointer over column till the point will till the point the left column is actually smaller than right column because two pointer will only run if there is some certain number of columns left so this is the entire code which we have to basically this is instruction manual actually which we have to code in the next part in the coding the problem rotate image in java language and for that first of all we were expecting two parts that is first was the transpose part. Second was the reverse rows part. In the transpose part what we did we just simply we will call the function transpose and we will pass the matrix. Same goes for reverse rows so I will just simply call the function reverse rows and pass the matrix and I will expect that both will do their work. So first of all let's try to code the transpose function. What we have to do in transpose as discussed we have to run a loop in the upper right triangle and swap every value at row comma column with the value at column comma row. So run a loop on all the rows that is row zero till row less than matrix dot length last row will be n matrix dot length and once we are running a loop over all the rows we have to do what we have to run a loop over all the columns till the starting from the rowth column till the last column that is for column equal to row column will be less than matrix of zero dot length. You can also use matrix dot length because it is a square matrix and column plus plus. and now what we have to do we have to basically swap the values present at row comma column with column comma row so I am quickly writing my own swap logic you can also use inbuilt function if they are present in your particular language so I will be passing the matrix I will be passing which cell that is which coordinate and which another cell that is with another coordinate I want to swap r1 comma c1 should be swapped with r2 comma c2 so how we can swap we can make a temporary variable of matrix of r1 comma c1 then matrix of r1 comma c1 will become matrix of r2 comma c2 that is make a is equals to b make b is equals to c and then finally make these equals to back to 10 so r2 comma c2 will become temporary variable so this is how you will swap so what we need to do we need to call the function swap where I will pass the matrix and I will swap row comma column with column comma row so row comma column will be swapped with column our row so r1 c1 will be row call r2 c2 will be call row once we have transpose let's see if we are actually getting the correct output for now I am letting the reverse rows function be empty so that we are able to get whether the transpose is working fine or not for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 transpose should be correct but currently there is some certain semicolon issue okay now I have added the semicolon let's now run it again to see if we are actually able to do the transpose and there is certain function name error so we are having function name as a transpose not transpose so let's run it again there are certain like logical errors or you can say syntactical errors so obviously output will be wrong because for now we have only implemented the first step but after transpose 1 2 3 is now actually in the first column then second row is in the second column in the actual output 7 8 9 is in the last column so a given row is becoming a given column given column is becoming a given row we are able to do the transpose now let's also do the reversing of each row so for that again run a loop on every row because we have to check that for a current row it should be having all the elements which used to be left to right now should they become right to left so for that run a two-pointer technique that is initialize a left pointer as zero initialize a right pointer as the last column matrix of zero dot length minus one this is the last column and do what run the two-pointer only till the point while left is a smaller than right till this point we have to run the two-pointer technique and every time what we need to do we need to swap the values present at in the matrix of row comma left with the matrix app of row comma right once we have swapped what we need to do into pointer when both the pointers are moving towards each other left will become left right will become minus minus so this is how you will reverse a given row and this is how you will reverse each and every row for the entire matrix so let's now run it again and now output should be the same as the expected output because now we have implemented both the steps and actually it is giving me the same output let's do it for a even number of rows or even number of columns also that is four rows four columns it should work fine for four rows also let's see if it is working fine or not and let me actually copy the last row let's run it again to see and then we will actually submit so code is also working fine for the four number of rows four number of columns and we are able to get all the test cases correct so this is the problem rotate image by 90 degrees this is the code how much is the time complexity as discussed n square how much is the space complexity space is only and only constant no extra space in place of solution because we are changing the same matrix itself now some follow-up questions which you can try it on your own can be instead of rotating 90 degree clockwise what if you have to rotate 90 degree anti-clockwise or 270 degree clockwise or 180 degree clockwise so all these types of rotations can be your homework problems and you have to try them again without taking any extra space that is you have to do in place so you can what will be the time complexity for them what will be the approach for them till then let's meet in the next video bye"

So basically what happened was whenever we switched some companies or whenever we do some interviews, the DSAs were a critical part of it, right? And in my college, I did not practice a lot of DSAs and although I told myself that DSAs are a major skill that I need to upscale myself on so that I get more opportunities from companies and get better placement. As they were taught by very experienced mentors, like I heard that some of them were in Google and all. So they guided the sessions very well and it was very elaborative and very easy to grasp the sessions. They already have so much knowledge to share their knowledge with us. Apart from that like they were able to tell us about like how they had their professional journey. We used to have friendly talks with them like we used to connect on LinkedIn and all sometimes. Now that Cryo has announced the alumni network so that like many of us are able to connect through LinkedIn and like the referral thing is very common in that so like that helped. So basically yeah be committed and be disciplined to help you upskill yourself and achieve the goals that you have set in your life."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem find if string permutation can form a palindrome we are given a string s which will consist of both lowercase and uppercase alphabetical letters it means there will be a string there will be a collection of characters and the characters will be either small a till small z or capital a till capital z lowercase and uppercase alphabets only you have to write a function to check if the string is a palindrome permutation or not if it is a permutation of a palindrome or not palindromic permutation now some points are given some notes are given the notes is characters are case sensitive it means small a is not same as capital a you have to treat them differently but the point is what is a palindromic permutation what is a string which is a permutation of a string and the answer is yes true why if I will make this string become n a then let's say m then again m then a n so this string n a double m a n this is a palindrome and this is a permutation of the original string why there are two ends there are two ends there are two a's there are two a's there are two m's there are two m's so each and every character is present same number of times so it is a palindrome answer is true what about hello there is no possible way to rearrange the characters of hello to make it a palindrome like hello itself is not a palindrome what are the strings which are palindromic strings which read same from left to right and right to left this n a double m a n it reads same as if i take any palindrome or any permutation you can say not palindrome but any permutation of hello it will not form a palindrome hello itself is not a palindrome if i take maybe e l l o h any other permutation like if you rearrange it in any other form it will never be going to become a palindrome so answer will be false same for capital a small a b why this string itself capital a small a b is not a palindrome if i take b in the middle capital a small b small a you would say it is a b a a b a in both the ends but as given in the question it is mentioned that characters are case sensitive small a should not be treated same as capital a so capital a should be treated differently than small a so these are different so again it is not a palindrome so there is no permutation of a a b where one is capital a another is small to make it a palindrome answer is false again i hope the question is clear that we have to check whether a palindromic permutation of the input string exists or not so we will be given a lot of strings but we have to write the function or write the code for one string that is to check one particular string whether it is true or false now the point is how we can actually find out see if i am giving a string a a b what you can do actually in order to check whether it is a palindromic permutation you can search for all the characters that is you can maybe try to first do the permutation of a a b as a a b itself that is a a b itself whether it is a palindrome or not check whether it is palindrome by running a loop from left to right and right to left by running two pointers and comparing is a equal to b no so it is not a palindrome room maybe take another permutation let's take baa now check whether this permutation is a palindrome or not so b is not same as a hence baa is not a palindrome but as soon as i take aba then it is read same as left to right right to left so yes it is a palindrome hence this input string aab was a palindromic permutation so answer will be true so one such brute force solution which we have discussed right now is find out all the permutations of a given string using any inbuilt function you can find out all the permutations in how much time in n factorial time why for a string having three characters if all the three characters are different the number of permutations of this string will be three factorial that is six permutations will be there a b c a c b b a c b c a c a b c b a these will be the six permutations so in worst case you have to check for all the permutations so it will be n factorial permutation permutations and to check whether a given permutation is a palindrome or not, you have to run a two-pointer technique for linear time overall time complexity will be n factorial into n. You can say it will be almost exponential very large time complexity, but the point is can we do better can we just solve it in maybe polynomial time not exponential time that is maybe n n square something like that and the answer is yes see if we are given the string n n a a m m the same string which was given in the input this was a palindromic permutation why we were able to take one n in the first another n in the last one a in the first one a in the last after n one m in the first another m in the last that is n n a a m m so can't we just check whether the number of characters are existing in pairs or not because if any character exists in pair. It can be placed one in the left hand side another in the right hand side one in the left hand side another in the right hand side one in the left hand side another in the right hand side and if you will keep on knowing it what will happen you will make sure that you are forming a palindrome because if one is in the left another is in the right same character though overall answer which you will create will become same when read from left to right and read from right to left also so what we have to do is we have to check whether all the characters whichever we have are existing in pairs or not if they exist in pairs then yes the answer is true the string is palindrome but will it be the only scenario when there will be a palindrome are there no corner cases are there only even length palindromes in this case we can say all characters were existing in pairs so yes the answer is true what about if one of the characters is four times let's say A is two times and small a is four times. In this case also you can say we can form a palindrome by two A in the left, two A in the right and capital A capital A in the middle. So it is not only pairs you can now say that instead of checking for pairs we can check for even count whether each and every character present in the input string is having even frequency or not. Small a having four frequency, capital A having two frequency, even frequency. So if it is even frequency it can be completely divided. Half of the characters will go in the left hand side, other half of the characters will go in the right hand side. So now a better thinking or a better solution will be check whether every character is even a number of times occurring or not. Not just in pairs but even number of times. But again will there be no corner case? The point is still we are taking an even length string only. How about an odd length string? Can an odd length string never become a palindrome? is no they can become actually that is if I take a string madam madam is a palindrome and it is of odd length 5 length but in this case you can say m is existing in pair or even length a is also existing in pair or even length but d is alone d is a single so in odd length string the middle character can be unique it cannot exist in pair like it can be in odd length so if I take a example of a is present four times capital a is present three times small b is present let's say four times or maybe six times what about this string will this string become a palindrome answer is yes why out of four a's to a in the starting to a in the last okay done out of six b's we can say three b's in the starting three b's in the last and the character which is capital a it is odd number of times so we can place all the characters in middle odd number of characters in the middle while because if there will be all characters in middle the middle most character it will not require a duplicate it will not require same element why because all these are same as this left to right right to left the same and middle is also same so we can say overall string is a palindrome so one character can have odd frequency what about two characters having odd frequency if I will take a string as a a a then capital B capital B capital B is this string ever going to form a palindrome is permutation ever going to be palindrome answer is no why out of two a let's say I am saying one in the left one in the right out of two B's out of three we are taking two we are saying one in the left one in the right now you have one a left as well as one B left so you have to take them in the middle obviously but as soon as you take it is this string a palindrome no from left to right it is a b a b b a from right to left it is a a b b a b a so it is not same so if there are two characters with odd frequency two characters with odd number of occurrences we can say answer is false two or more than two even if there are three characters obviously then also it will be false so either the number of characters with odd frequency number of characters with odd frequency it should be either zero that is all characters are in pairs even length palindrome or the odd number of characters the characters with odd frequency it should be only one such character which is having odd frequency there should not be more than one characters with odd frequency so we can check this in order to optimize the solution in order to write the solution in polynomial time and how much polynomial first of all we have to figure out the frequency of each character given the string we can use a data structure to store the frequency of each element in order to store the frequency we need the character comma we need the frequency of that character that is for n n a m m we have to store n comma 2 a comma 2 m comma 2 so these are key value pairs and the data sector which can be used to store key value pairs is hash map or you can simply map that is we have to implement hashing algorithm we can use any inbuilt functions to do it but we have to use a key value pair data sector in order to store the character as the key comma the value as a frequency of that character of that key and once we know the characters frequency for each character we can check how many odd characters are there how many characters with odd frequency are there if number of characters with odd frequency are either 0 or 1 good enough string is a palindrome return true otherwise if number of characters with odd frequency are more than 1 that is at least 2 if they are then answer is false so this is the logic and to maintain the data sector since we are going to maintain a key value pair data sector We are going to run a loop on the input string to find out the frequency of each character. It will take order of n time. Second thing, now to check whether which characters have odd frequency, we have to run a loop on the key value pair. We have to check for each character what is the frequency of it. So how many different characters can be there, 26 lowercase, 26 uppercase in the hash map or in the hashing algorithm data set, the key value pair data structure. There can be at max 52 different types of characters, only unique characters will be there. So the second loop will require order of 52 time, which is almost constant. So overall time complexity will be linear only. What about space complexity? As told, the hash map will be required, but hash map will be at max of 52 size only because different number of characters are only 52. So the hash map will take constant space in terms of strings, because even though the string might be of this much length. length 1 lakh or 10 to the power of 5 length whatever but the number of unique characters among those 10 lakh characters or those 10 to the power of 5 6 whatever characters are there the number of unique characters will be only 52 so space complexity will be constant time complexity will be linear let's just do what let's directly jump on to the instruction manual that is milestone 3 now the approach is done so what we are going to say is create a hash map create a hash create a hash map of character as key and integer as frequency because the frequency will be the value we can say integer will be the value because frequency is nothing but integer so let's say the hash map name is frequency let's say the hash map name is frequency and what we need to do is run a loop on every character on the input string run a loop over all characters of input string s and just insert them in the hash map so do the frequency plus plus for the character in hash map do the value plus plus for the current character as key for the current character key in the hash map obviously that is whatever character we will have we will do the frequency plus plus let's say initially the hash map is empty we will say n frequency plus plus 0 plus 1 will become 1 again n is there 1 plus 1 will become 2 a is there 0 plus 1 will become 1 again a is there 1 plus 1 will become 2 m is there put the new frequency which is 0 plus 1 1 and now again m so 1 plus 1 2 so whichever character is there just do the frequency plus plus and take the old frequency as 0 if it is not there default value should be taken as 0 so do the value plus plus for the current character in frequency hash map once we know every character's frequency now we to maintain a variable odd which will count the number of characters with odd frequency so set odd variable odd integer variable let's say with value zero initially zero characters are there with odd frequency with value zero and now run a loop over all the characters in hash map over all characters in hash map check if the frequency of that character is odd or not check if value of that character of that key is odd or not if it is if it is odd then what we have to do we have to just simply do the odd plus plus odd will increment by one and finally we need to check whether the number of characters with odd frequency are zero one or more than one so if the characters with odd frequency is zero or one then we can say yes answer is true so then return true we can have a palindromic permutation otherwise we can't add so else we have to return false so this will be the pseudocode now we will be writing the code in Java programming language so first of all what was required is we have to create a hash map that is a key value pair data structure hash map with key as character value as integer that is character will have how much frequency that we need to store let's say the hash map name is hash map itself and we will say as soon as we write this line we are creating an empty hash map with zero key value pairs initially now to fill it we have to run a loop on the input string so I will run a loop on all the characters of input string that is from index 0 till index less than string dot length and whatever character we have we will do the frequency of that character plus plus so for that we have to get the old frequency first so let's say old frequency will be the frequency hash map dot get is the function name and put the character that is s dot character at index the current character but if the old frequency is not there if the character is not present in the hash map what should we take initially we should take the frequency as 0 so we have to take the default value as 0 but get function will not return 0 if the character is not present if the key is not present it will give you null we don't need a null we actually need 0 so we can use a function get or default and we can pass a second parameter as 0 which will give me value 0 when the key the current character is not present in the hash map that is when it is being added for the first time old frequency will be 0 and new frequency will become 0 plus 1 so now what we have to do put the frequency of the same character but this time as old frequency plus 1 that is frequency will become plus plus the value will become plus plus so this is how we have to do frequency plus plus in Java language for a hash month once we are having the frequency of each character let's just for now print the frequency frequency hash map to confirm whether all the characters are getting correct frequency or not. So let's just return true in the last for now and see if the output of the hash map is correct or not. All the key value pairs are getting constructed easily or not. So there is some problem with the return type. The return type is integer in Java that is for the answer as true what we have to do as you can see if a flag is one return true or print true actually. So we have to not return true we have to return one instead of true similarly for false instead of returning false return zero. So if I will run it again hopefully the hash map should be printed for now. So it is A2M2N2 for the string NNAAMM and for the string hello it is E1H1L2O1 in some order hash map does not have ordering. So the hash map is getting constructed correctly but now the point is how we can actually check the number of characters with odd frequency. So for that we are maintaining an odd variable initially zero that is still now there are no characters with odd frequency and now we will run a loop over the hash map. How you can run a loop over the keys of hash map? One by one we will get a key using the hash map frequency dot key set function. Key set will actually give you the set of all the keys and you are running a loop on all those keys and one by one getting the character and to get the value get the frequency of that character you can just use the get function so you can just say the value is nothing but frequency dot get key and now we have to check whether this value is odd or not. If this value modulus two is one this is the condition to check whether a value is odd or not. We have to do frequency or not frequency but the odd number of frequency plus plus odd variable plus plus and why we are doing it we need to check whether the input string have how many characters with odd frequency with the unique element which can be taken in the middle at most one middle can be there that's why we need to check either the number of characters with odd frequency should be zero or the number of odd frequencies should be one you can simply write it like the odd should be less than equal to one also in this case we have to return one otherwise we have to return zero so else we can say return zero let's just run this code and see if it is now working for all the test cases hopefully it should let's see it is taking some time to run let's wait for the output so sample test case is working the first test case is a palindromic permutation so true answer is there and hello is not a palindromic permutation so false answer is there let's just submit it to confirm for all the test cases again taking some time to run but hopefully it will be correct for all the test cases and it will get accepted you so as you can see all the 28 test cases are getting accepted and the time complexity as we have discussed in the approach video we can discuss it again we are creating a loop we are running a loop over all the characters of input string if input string have n characters this loop will be running for n time the get function or the put function or the get or default function all these functions in ash map take constant time in average case so overall this loop will be constant functions so overall loop will take linear time only that is order of n time only what about the second loop since the frequency dot key set function will only return unique keys and number of unique keys can be 52 at max the second loop will run for 52 times in worst case that is constant time so linear plus constant is linear only so overall time complexity is linear order of n what about space as told hash map will only contain unique keys that is 52 keys in worst case The space complexity is a constant even though there is auxiliary data such as hash map still space is constant due to the number of keys present in that it is independent of the string length because the string can have a lot of characters with same same value but the hash map will only have unique characters. So that is a problem find if the string permutation can form a palindrome or not with that we are done with all the five milestones we will meet in a new video with a new problem till then bye bye take care."

        "transcription": "Now, we will try to understand the if-else or conditionals in Java. So for that, we will take one real-world example. We all have bank account, right? Most probably everyone would have a bank account for sure. So let's take that particular example itself. Let's say you have a bank account in ABC Bank. Let's say you have a bank account in ABC Bank and now you want to apply for credit card from that bank. If you want to apply for credit card, will they give credit card to everyone or it will be given on the basis of some criteria? For example, let it be your salary. Will they give you credit card on the basis of your salary? For example, if your salary is more than 100 rupees, if salary is greater than 100 rupees, then only you will be provided with credit card. Or do you think they will give credit card to everyone? pause the video and try to think through it and then come back later. Everyone please try to pause the video and think through it and then we will discuss it further. Okay, so I think everyone one will agree to it that a credit card is something which will not be given to everyone. They will have some criteria in order to provide the credit card. So let's stick to our condition of salary. So can I say this if salary is greater than hundred rupees if salary is greater than hundred rupees then eligible for credit card. Yes, if salary is greater than hundred rupees then you are eligible for credit card else not eligible for credit card. I hope everyone would agree to this. If my salary is greater than hundred rupees I am eligible for credit card else I am not eligible. So can I say this based on some criteria or some condition You are provided the credit card. So these are the scenarios in real world where you will use conditionals. These are the scenarios where we will go ahead and use conditions or conditionals in Java. So one of that is if else if else condition in Java. So let's try to visualize this same problem statement on if else how it would work. So first of all, we will say that okay, if some condition if a particular condition holds true, if this condition holds true, we will execute a piece of statement else. We will execute something else. So whatever you want to say that, okay, if my condition is true execute this part you have to provide that in curly bracket. So whatever I will write in line number nine. right whatever statement you will write in line number 19 will be executed only if your condition is true else statement 2 will be executed. Else statement 2 will be executed. This is your statement 2. This is how you will write conditions in Java. Okay, let's fit that same salary condition into this template. Let's try to visualize that. So basically you will write if salary is greater than hundred if salary is greater than hundred let's say I'll write a normal print statement. System.out.println eligible for credit card. If your salary is greater than hundred you are eligible for credit card else system.out.println not eligible for credit card not eligible for credit card. So basically what we have done if the condition holds true if the condition holds true. So this is my condition. If my salary is greater than 100 I am eligible for a credit card else I am not eligible for credit card. So this is the overall syntax of if else conditional in Java. So basically we have only come up with the syntax. Now we will try to write a actual program for the same. So for this I'll make use of main.java. What is the variable in this particular piece of code? Everyone please try to think through it and you can pause the video for time being just try to analyze which one is the variable on which I have written my condition. Yes, so the variable over here is salary. So I'll declare a variable int salary is equal to let's say 900. Yes, my salary is equal to 90 rupees if salary is greater than 100. I am eligible for credit card else. I am not eligible. So let's try to analyze this particular program and we will try to predict the output. Let's try to predict the output. Okay, my salary is 90. So let's check the condition over here. So this will be my condition is 90 greater than 100. Everyone, please try to think through it and answer. Is 90 greater than 100? No, so this is false. Since my condition is false, it will not execute the if part it will go to else part. So I will be printed an output of not eligible for credit card. Let's run this and validate. Yes. So we are printed the output of not eligible for credit card. Let's modify our salary. Let's make our salary as 190. We will again check our condition is 190 greater than 100. Is this true? Yes, 190 for short will be greater than 100. So this condition is true. Now, since my condition is true, it will execute the if part. So let's have a look at if block if curly bracket. So inside if curly bracket line number 5 will be executed. What does it say eligible for credit card? So let's run this and validate if we are getting output as eligible for credit card. So we are able to get an output of eligible for credit card. Thank you for playing. Have a nice day. you"

        "transcription": "Hey guys, today we are going to be ranking programming languages for beginners. I am going to start with Javascript. Javascript is going to be good because it is pretty beginner friendly and you will always need it for web development. However, you usually have to pair it with HTML, CSS and a few other frameworks so that's why I am not putting it in really good. Java is going to be really good because it is good to learn DSA in Java and a lot of companies do look for Java developers so that's going to be really good. C++ is a really good language, however, for beginners it might be a bit hard so I am going to put it in mid and it doesn't have the same standalone value as Java unless you are in game development. Python is the most intuitive language guys so that's going to be really good. If you are trying coding for the first time, this is definitely the language to go to. You can also take it really far and land quite a few good jobs with Python. PHP, I know a lot of the internet is based on PHP, however, I am going to put it in not recommended because it is a server side programming language and if you are just starting out programming, there is no need to go to PHP. You have a lot of other alternatives."

The structure of the Cryo program, it is so simplified. It is planned such that at every sprint, I'm gaining the necessary skill set which will be useful for my future. They always come up with some examples and analogies. I attended the live mentorship. They told me about what the things are in the industries. They also gave ideas how to face the interview. Before coming to Cryo, I had no knowledge in coding. But after coming to Cryo, they first initiated me with the coding and programming skills. Here, I learned modularizing the code, writing the test cases. and developing the scripts, everything it is so resembling to the real world experience. For the future learners who are from different backgrounds like me, it is very easy to back them up if they spend more hours."

I have to take care of the family and work, uh, you know, attend interviews. So yeah, again, it's, it's a kind of difficult for me, but. My name is Uday. I've completed my graduation. So B.Com examples are the practice that was, uh, easy to learn. So I got to join the cryo to do application testing or mobile testing. So I thought that's a good time to learn about automation testing and, you know, growing to more of a software testing by learning automation testing. They provide placements, uh, they scheduled interviews, but I was not fully prepared for that. But again, coming to the programming part, it was a good learning. The examples, the practice, the sessions, I mean, support, everything is helpful to learn. Yeah. I tried my best. And again, the support and the training, everything was provided by cryo is good. There's practice sessions, which they build up with some kind of a user friendly and understandable. The air group is also to help me out in learning automation. It's totally on me. I became a senior QA here. It's a startup company and I'm the alone who's taking care of the testing part. And it's more like whatever I've learned here and whatever the confidence I got here, that's what I'm using currently in my job. The knowledge which I've got shared from the mentors, peers. I guess some of the sessions, we also had interview sessions. In that interview sessions, they have also explained how the software company works and what are the questions we might get while working. So those all things are working out for me. With the help of all those sessions and the mentor sessions and the peers support and everything which I got through Cryo, I'm using all of them in this current company and doing good currently. I think for young people who are working hard to become something in their life, this is the best time to take an opportunity of this kind of automation learning, especially with Cryo. We have a great sessions and practice modules. That's really helped the people who doesn't know about the coding much, but they can take an opportunity of learning those things and put a lot of interest. And if they put a lot of interest, like if you put about 18 hours in a We can achieve things, and we can learn these courses, and do better things in the course. That's true that if we put that time, then yes, definitely we'll achieve it, do something with the course we've learned."

Now, if you want to go from one part of the city to another, then Google uses a special data structure called graph. Graph creates the digital map of the city and finds the shortest route possible. Now, when you enter your destination, then Google Maps becomes a super explorer. It uses smart algorithms like breadth-first search to analyze the graph and find all the possible paths to your destination. But what if there are many paths to your destination? It analyzes the length of each path and suggests the shortest route possible. And this is how Google Maps armed with DSA gives you the shortest route possible to your destination.

Like I have seen now really suddenly there is this trend of everybody wanting to be a data scientist, like why? There are different segments of tech, right? There's development side of it, right? Then there's the testing side of it, then there's cloud. Now, since with a lot of data, understanding and analyzing data. So how do you see these opportunities? In undergrad, we are very theory based, right now, even now also. That's how it was. So in association with the theory, what additional should I? I can maybe think so, at least from my side of experience, what I feel is. So first, let's say you're a computer science engineer and you want to go into the field and there are multiple sectors, like how you've told, right? There is development, there's testing, there's user design. First, try to understand what. it in for you and you don't have to completely understand but if there are five different six things so today if they think about tech is not only about coding there are so many different things so understand the profile and then start applying for internships i feel like internship is a really good way having said that when i have done intern later i have gone to bsnl i've done lab view uh things so when you try your hands at different things you'll know what your strengths or what your passion is so let's say in that case you are trying to understand and learn that it's going to be coding now again in coding once you have narrowed down understand what are the industries which is there uh the more you keep on doing one step further you'll start getting opportunities along the way you'll be exposed like maybe you might come across a hackathon maybe you'll read an article maybe you'll meet somebody who's done it the world will they'll also start bringing you close at that point so let's say when it's going to be coding at least for coding perspective i would say don't go with this thing that just because it's famous that you want to do like i have seen now really suddenly there is this trend of Everybody wanting to be a data scientist. Like, why? I was about to say that. Just because that's the job now, don't do it. Do it only if you're passionate about it and you feel good doing it. But yeah, like she said, keep trying out things. Nowadays, lot of people maintain such cool GitHub repositories, you know, where they try out things. Probably someone else has already tried it. That's fine. They still try out a lot of things of their interest, keep their code over there. And you have a lot of learning avenues and a lot of free courses as well. So it's not enough just if you're with your textbook and, you know, passing your exams and getting a good percentage. As we said that, right, I feel like now there is this one thing of following the fad which has been going. And also about do limited but then be really good at it. Like when I just started my career, there was at least during my time. It was the thing about learning multiple languages. Like you should know what five, six languages. Yeah, it was around that point. And when I used to meet people, they'll be like, one will learn Python, one will Java, one will learn JavaScript. I was very confused about what I learned. Then I met a generation of engineers who are solid, who knew only C++ or C. Then I understood if you're so strong in one language, you can always make a parallel transition to multiple things. Then I just stuck with Java. I'm still now stuck with Java. So if it's going to be some other language, I'll try to relate it to that. Obviously, you need to have the ability to go for multiple things, but don't try out little and try to reduce on what you have to go for and go depth into something. And then you will be able to figure out what you have to take, you know, more into, oh, you have learned this coding language, then you become more better at it. Now, understand, oh, is there something like a backend, for example, when it comes to engineering. So try first a breadth-first approach and then go depth-wise, then it will be easier. Yeah. you"

        "transcription": "Welcome everyone, I am really happy to be here and being part of this Automation Edge event and chatting with Tushar. Hey Tushar, thanks a lot for taking time out on a Saturday morning and talking to our audience. So before we just jump in, I think a quick context for you, I think we have, typically I was just asking for the registrations, what kind of audience we have for today. So we have two kinds of audience, I think there are people who are already kind of working as professionals, looking to kind of move to a better career in terms of advancing their career, learning what's happening in the automation space. And we also have some part of the audience who are kind of aspiring to get into automation space. So we have both kind of audience. Right. I'm sure in your experience and insights will be valuable for both kind of audience, right? So I think let's get started, right? So I think you have 10 plus years of experience across multiple MNCs, right? Dell, Wells Fargo, Walmart, all of that, right? So I think you've kind of grown through the ranks, right? And I'm sure you have seen evolution of SDLC, right? Software Development Lifecycle over the last 10 years. Things, a lot of things have changed, right? I think let's start with kind of at least hearing your observation, right? I think if you just look back the last 10 years, right? What has changed, right? With respect to overall Software Development Lifecycle, with respect to how people think about testing the products we develop for consumers, right? What has changed? I think that'll be a good starting point for us to dive into it. That's a quite an interesting question, and I think, you know. absolutely right. I think you, me, all of us who have been around 10 years or more, we have seen how the industry has kind of evolving and especially in terms of tech. I think a decade back we were just making software products but now I think with the introduction of a lot of technologies like AI, a lot of technologies like ML, the overall technology spree has gone to a different level altogether. The kind of products which are being built in the market, 10 years back I think using a smartphone itself was the most fascinating thing we had in our lives but look at now and everybody is kind of using products like Alexa, Siri in the phone. There's a lot of AI which we are all using intentionally, unintentionally in our daily lives. I think overall technology has changed a lot. The curve itself has gone completely high and I think with that changing, the only thing from where I see, the only thing which happens is that it brings us a lot of opportunities for us as engineers, us as as the front face of technology teams. It brings a lot of opportunities to learn, a lot of opportunities to grow. And yes, so testing in terms of testing has become very wide. 10 years back, if I remember, the industry was more about having manual testers come to the office, pick up application, work on it, see if the application is working fine. The depth of understanding at which testing has gone now, I think it has vast. People are expected to test the application in a much more different ways. It's just not plain UI testing or just not plain database testing. But the industry is moving more towards SDETs, more towards having people who are more focused towards automation. And that's where you help these engineering teams to kind of keep moving faster, keep growing faster. So I think testing itself has kind of taken a long ride in the last 10 years. Got it. I think it'll be great. I think it'll be kind of great to narrate the story through your own experience. So, could you just help us understand, when you started your career, what was the nature of work, what you used to do? And then probably need not share a lot of specifics, but what was the day-to-day activities used to be? How the role has evolved? One, I think, with the industry changing, and also when you started growing in your responsibilities. Absolutely. I can put some glimpse on that. So I think when I started my career, probably back in 2011, when I started my career, I started as a manual tester. And I had a lot of manual testing, which I used to do for the initial first one and a half year. But I was probably one of the last ones where I got exposure towards automation testing much earlier in my career. The manual testing you were doing, was it kind of domain heavy system where you had some domain specific knowledge? It was. So in the initial phases, when I started working, it was more of a banking system. And probably you would be able to relate and a lot of people who will be able to relate. Most of the banking technologies used to work on something called IBM mainframe back in those days, more heavy system on that. So the systems were used to be not so intuitive. And that was my first domain that I walked into, where I know some domain experience is something which really helps, but that is something which you build on the job when you start working on it. I think technology is one thing which we can learn, certainly, even before we get into a job. But domain is something which probably you learn as you start getting involved in different kinds of products, different kinds of projects, that's what you start looking at the domain. So you're doing a banking manual testing, right? That's where you started? Yes. Yes, that's where I started. I was doing a banking manual testing. And from there, I moved on to a different project where I picked up on the retail space. I started working for Hilton Hotels, the global Hilton Hotels, which was a completely different domain for me. And I could see a complete difference. But one thing which stayed common across both the projects was... my contribution and thought process, which I had towards testing. So I think being a QA, what you bring on the table is a non-developer mindset, where your approach towards any application, be it from any domain, be it any kind of application, your approach is to see how the user experience of the application is, be it a banking application, be it a hotel booking site or be it any other retail application, your contribution is to ensure that your users have a good experience when they use the application. So that still remained constant and the domain kept changing for me. So in the second role, were you doing some part of automation? What technologies have started picking up that? So at that point, late in 2012, I think I started doing a POC on Selenium. That was the first time I did a POC. Selenium was fresh and hot in the market at that point of time. I had some background understanding on Java, so I started working on doing a POC on Selenium. you know, the API world was more about soap, us using soap APIs, those days, and, you know, rest was still trying to shape up and, you know, still not a very widely accepted most of the banking technologies, but all soap API heavy, I had some, you know, licensed tools, which I was using soapUI pro and other API automation tools, API testing tools are that not automation API testing tools, started doing a POC around Selenium, seeing how automation can be feasible. First thing was, it was way too new, you don't had a lot of a lot of support, like you have cryo and multiple other platform learning platforms today, you don't add the support back then it was all fresh, you had to research a lot to kind of do a POC and learn how the technology or the tool really works. So that's what started my career towards automation. And I have been in the automation journey since 2012. How did the automation career evolve? I think I understand you started doing Selenium bit of exploration, right? How did the role evolve in terms of complexity and the tech stack? what was the next role from then? So after that, from the Dell project, I was working on the Hilton where I did a lot of UI automation. It was purely on a UI automation, which I was trying out over there in terms of POC. Then I moved to my next company, which was Wells Fargo, which was a core banking system, which where, if I tell in layman terms, it's pretty much what we do on net banking, the wire transfer payments, what we do. So I worked on a wire transfer payment, which was heavy on the backend side, but also had a little simple looking UI. My automation exposure somehow grew over there, where I was exposed to API automation and see how API automation can be done better. I think even while we talk about cryo curriculum, we talk about certain parts, we talk about rest assured. There were other couple of technologies back then where we had API automation. So that became new to me in terms of, I was doing some bit of UI, then I came across API automation. is a very interesting space where you see how you operate on something which you don't see on the browser. It's all the back-end automation. So it's again a different world but a good learning experience and from there on I think eventually I moved on to Deutsche Bank which was a complete automation testing role where my role was only to do automation day in and day out. Were you involved in developing some frameworks there or were you using existing frameworks? In Wells Fargo, I was still leveraging some open tools which were there to do the API automation but as soon as I moved to Deutsche Bank and that's where I started building a lot of heavy frameworks. I was a part of the SDAT role there. I used to build automation frameworks which were used by a lot of test automation engineers. These frameworks had a fairly simple approach, simple designs which could be adapted easily where maintenance could be easy because again the product I was working on in Deutsche Bank was a banking product which was rolled out across 35 countries. So every country had some different integrities which were incorporated over there. So overall, the application was big, but yeah, when you build automation on such applications, you start learning aspects of framework development on how to keep things simple, still leverage it to its full use. So a lot of design patterns, a lot of understanding comes into picture over there, start learning that. And over there, I think, apart from UI and backend automation, my other exposure increased quite a lot towards DevOps and database migration testing, quite a lot of these things. My application was purely based on Pega. So I started building certain dashboards where we could take care of certain infra components. I'm testing something in the QA environment, is my environment up and running or not, is my environment right? So all I could see is the scope of automation increasing and automation is not about selenium. Selenium is a part of automation, but automation is a concept where you can reduce any kind of manual work. which you are doing. And I think, if we all stick to that, that's where a lot of value add comes to us individually in our career on terms of learning, and also in terms of what we contribute. I think from there to Walmart, I think Walmart has been more of a completely a full stack QA role where Walmart doesn't have the concept of having different QA teams, it's you are tied to a product and you take care of end to end testing requirement, you do all the required manual testing, do all the required automation testing and database migration project. We moved from Azure to our SQL platform or different from all the database migration, performance testing, everything is that the QA teams are kind of responsible to take care of that over there. So it's a complete different exposure, a lot of learning in terms of how a product works end to end, functionally, and you learn the non-functional aspects of a system when you build a product. And that really helps, that really helps widen your... that process and horizon in terms of how a product is built and put in the market. Amazing. I think it's, it's quite a, quite a vast, I think, experience and journey, right? Thanks. Thanks for kind of sharing. I think this really helps people to think about, kind of visualize how potentially the career can shape up. Right. I think one interesting word you used, I want to just double down on, right, you talked about non-developer mindset, right? So a lot of people actually, when we talk to them, right, they think, should I do development? Should I do automation? What is good? Right. Like I generally tell them, there's nothing called what is good. Right. It's about what do you want to do? Right. And what do you think you can do well? Right. So I think, I think there's inherently, there's a different approach, right? I think there are certain kind of mindset, people with certain kind of mindset can be successful as a, as a developer, right. And people with certain kind of mindset can be really successful as, I think, SDETs, right? So I kind of see, I've been a product manager for a long time, right? So I actually always seen SDETs as my close. partner in crime, right? In bringing customer perspective to the table, right? So I think it'll be absolutely right. I can actually throw some light on like, how should someone think about kind of SDET role versus developer role and the non-developer mindset, you highlighted, I think it's a right. Absolutely, I think you brought on the right point. See, I think, you know, I think we talk about a different group of people who work on a product, right? You have product managers who work closely with the business. You have QAs who test the application, what we call testing manual or automation. We have developers who actually build the application. But if you see the mindset really change, you know, developers are people who are very close to tech in terms of, and they are building technology products day in day out. But in a QA role, the benefit from where I see is the QA role is a role where you stay close to business, you stay close to process, and you stay equally close to tech with automation being involved over there. leveraging role. And an interesting point, I think what you said, right. And I've also met a lot of people who come to me and say that, you know, there are a lot of development tools coming up, there's a lot of AI-based tools coming up, chat GPT coming up, will it kind of reduce the scope of automation testing? So I think my only answer to them was, at the end of it, whatever technologies we use, we are building products. You are building Alexa, you are building a smartwatch, you're building a basic smartphone, you're just putting technology behind it. The difference between a product getting a one-star rating or a five-star rating, that is software testing, that is software testing to me. Because that is where you represent the masses, you represent the entire user community who's going to use that product. You don't think from the angle where, you know, how I have built this product and what it should work. Rather, you think from a non-developer mindset where you represent the user community and think how I can do this application. It's a very simple example. If I am a developer, I develop a login page. I'll always go and test it with two or three combinations of login page, but if you are a tester, you would think on how would 10 users at different education levels, layman, would use this application. And you would parse in all possible combinations, some silly, some logical, but you would test it with all the possible boundaries to see if the application is robust or not. And that's the value which we bring as a QA role as testing mindset, where you see how robust is the development code, how well it can stand on functional parameters, where it is working across different kind of users, across different kind of users, and how the application can keep scaling up. Is my application good to be used for 10 people? Is it good to be used for 1000 people? Is it good to be used by a lakh number of people? That's the kind of testing which you bring. That's why it's a non-developer mindset. You don't only think about how the... application is built or made and what it needs to be done but you think it from a user mindset on what you expect from the application to be done and how it should be performing for a user experience to be good. Yeah great I think this is very insightful I think we try always having this conversation whenever someone asks this question I think it's great to hear this from you as well right so moving on right so one thing I think you have seen a lot of organizations kind of moving from let's say a manual approach to kind of testing to kind of completely as that kind of a thought process right so it's a cultural change right at the individual level as well as at an organization level right so right yeah what's been your observation or what's been your experience of teams and individuals moving from manual to automation right what is the kind of mindset change they should bring in themselves to kind of navigate and manage this change really well and I see I think I think one thing which I I've shared it is you know a lot of people when they try to switch from manual to automation, they define or they establish a restriction around them so that they want to do UI automation, they want to go and learn this particular tool. And my two cents for people are, see, when you want to move to the technology, which is from manual, you want to move more towards automation, to always learn the technology, don't learn tools, tools come and go. And I've seen so many tools come and go, we talk about Selenium. Selenium is, though it's a tool, but it's more of a platform which has evolved in terms of UI automation testing. There are so many tools which have been built, which are on top of Selenium. So if you know Selenium, you know how a UI automation is done. If I know Java, for example, I know how object-oriented programming works. Tomorrow you can fit into any other programming. So similarly, don't restrict your learning to tools, restrict it towards technology, learn the technology. If you learn a technology, you will always be on the safer side where tools will come and go and you will always be able to adapt. to them. And that's a very important aspect because the tools keep changing. As we evolve, tools keep changing. Similar example, if you know driving, it doesn't matter which vehicle, which brand I put you into, you will still be able to drive. So that should be the mindset when you switch from manual to automation and restrict, don't restrict your contributions. In a project, don't think that my job is only to come and do your automation. Identify opportunities, see what opportunities you have in your project where you can go and contribute with automation. Is there something which you can do as a stretch assignment for yourself? And those such assignments, that's where a lot of value comes to you from your own learning point of view. And that really helps you transition from a manual testing role to automation testing role. I think we talked about kind of mindset, right? But I think from a hard skills perspective, what are the key skills and other qualities an aspiring automation engineer should actually think about in should a board kind of grow into, right, with ever-evolving the industry landscape, right? Yeah, right. So I think in terms of skillset, I think one thing which goes very handy and which is more of a baseline to scale up yourself as an automation tester is, you know, have a good understanding on Java. So Java becomes a very, very important tool. I would not ask you to go and learn Java to an extent where you start building applications. Learn Java to an extent where you are able to take care of any kind of automation which is required. Here we keep getting questions about Java versus Python, right? So do you have any thoughts or is it just a choice? Yeah, see, first, quick answer, it's just a choice, but I would always suggest when you want to learn something new or when I've taken a call to upskill myself, why would I not want to upskill myself which has wide pool of opportunities in the market rather than something which is still a comparatively narrower pool. So if I'm learning from a manual to automation role, I would prefer to pick still Java because that exposes me to a wide set of opportunities where Python still has certain restrictions. It is being used but if you see the market pattern, Java has a much wider control in the market compared to any other programming language. So I would suggest switch to Java, learn Java that exposes you to a wider pool of opportunities. Absolutely fine. So I think Java is one thing which comes really handy because Selenium and all they are more from a tool perspective which you use, you integrate with Java and do a lot of UI automation but a lot of value and the such assignments which I was telling you which you can do in a project, they can pick up certain smaller roles, certain smaller tasks and automate. That's where Java comes really handy, that way you can build a lot of Java utilities, you can build a lot of Java related automation stuff, which would really come really handy and your overall understanding goes much better. And while you learn Java, I think one thing which is very important to focus on, I met a lot of people in the mentorship sessions and they come to me asking, how well should I understand data structures? How well should I understand collections? See, these are important to understand stuff. But before you go there, make your foundation very strong. Because if you are switching, and if you are taking up classes where you want to understand Java, and to land up into a tier one company, tier one company will never focus on how advanced concepts you know, they focus on how well you understand the code which you write, they might give you a very simple program to remove duplicates from an array, but they would ask you to write, explain the 10 lines which you write over there. Because what do you want to understand is your thought process? Are you thinking the right way? Are you thinking the right logic, syntax programming that still can be later. So I think focus on that where you build the right amount of skill set with Java. Selenium as an automation tool will really come handy to you to understand how UI automation is done. And from a backend automation point, I think it's good to learn one tool, which is rest assured, and have minimal exposure at least towards the non-functional aspect of an application, which is the performance testing, load testing, how application behaves in terms of on a big billion day typically, how the application will behave. It's important to understand that it works, how it works. So that's where some concept of performance testing, load testing would really help you. I think if we cover this much of a skill sets, you will be able to build a lot of knowledge on top of it as you grow. But I think this will be a good starter kit to kind of look forward to for the next one or two years to kind of be at that mark to know all these technologies. I'm getting some audience questions about salary ranges. Do you mind actually, I think, roughly, right, I think. I think people have a notion about how does the, a lot of people don't know about the SDET salary ranges typically, right? I think, of course, it varies. If you could at least share a broad, at least, like somebody who's really qualified automation engineer, what are the typically entry-level salaries someone can expect, right? And probably at three years and five years, how would it? Yeah, certainly. So I think, you know, I wouldn't, so again, my numbers might not be totally right over here, but this is more from my observation, which I have seen over the last 10 or 11 years. See, industry has also evolved in terms of how the payout has been. And especially in the last two, two and a half years, the whole dimensions around the market have changed. It certainly depends around the companies which you're targeting, to be very honest. If you target companies, which are tier one companies, which are like Amazon, Google, Intuit, Microsoft, if you target companies like these to start with, at a three or five year experience, in terms of automation. your pay could be somewhere around 15 or around that to start with or could be a little more than that. But if you target certain other service-based companies which I have felt, the service-based companies go a little lower side of the pay. They have a little different model of payout. So I think somewhere around 6 to 7 and plus is what can vary around. I think people should not really worry about the pay packages until and unless your skillsets arrive. I felt that IT is a very welcoming space, an unbiased space where all that matters is how you perform in that room when you're in an interview. Nothing before that, nothing after that. If you perform, if you do really well, I think companies, there are a lot of companies and with the startup culture evolving so much, I think there are a lot of startups who kind of go on a very exorbitant range, pay you really high. Salaries go, I believe, somewhere around from 6 lakh of packages for a 3 to 4 year experience, somewhere from 6 to 7. 7 lakh of packages per annum, it goes as high as what I have seen at that experience, based on the kind of companies you pick, based on the kind of companies you work for. I think since you're talking about salary, right, one typical question I generally whenever I do some mentorship calls I get is, I'm working as a manual QA, right, because of the domain expertise they have, probably they get paid slightly on the higher end, let's say, like 10 to 15 lakhs as a manual QA, right, and when they think about kind of moving into automation, generally people have worry about, because I don't have an automation experience, would my salary grow, would my salary not grow, should I be okay with a similar salary or slightly lower salary also, right, this is something, a dilemma I've seen a lot of people going through, right, it's a personal choice, right, I think it'd be good to share some kind of framework, if you were them, how do you think about it, yeah. thing that was, you know, see, if you choose to stay closer to technology, you will always be on the higher paying, paying, paying ends, you know, the further you decide to stay from technology, I think that's where challenges occur for you. But if you are somebody who is either a developer or a tester, a product function is the function of differently product is itself a very different space on how things work. It's a very high paying space. But in terms of QA rule, if you're deciding if you are somebody who's already earning about 10 to 15 lakhs an annum, and if you're a manual tester, and if you opt to move towards a SDET rule or a QA rule, I think certainly you should not be be worried about the pay pattern, because the moment you decide to stay more positive technologies, your pay will kind of go even even better. It's always it's always a client graph, they go up, there's there's no decline when you try to choose to stay close to technology and build a lot of automation that that always works out better for you. Hey, thanks. I think probably I'll just go with my last question. I think we're almost on time. Right. So I think if you have a lot of people who are already working as a Q automation professionals and who are aspiring to get into as well. Right. So I think we have shared a lot of insights about your own career journey. I think that is very insightful. Right. And we talked about what skills they should look at, what mindset they should look at, which is more important. Right. So I think what would be your kind of piece of advice for everyone in their upskilling journey and in their kind of planning their next career move? Yes, I think whenever we decide to upskill, right, we decided we decide based on the market trend to decide on seeing how we can secure a future for ourselves for the next five or eight years. And we do these things. But when you start a learning journey, see learning journey is not a simple journey. You have to stay very focused. You have to stay patient towards. what you are learning. One day you decide to learn automation, it will not be that after a week you will learn automation. It takes its own journey. You take a journey where you put in the right focus. What I have seen a lot of people do is they start with a journey and in a month's time when things get a little bit complicated or you start learning some better or advanced concept you kind of feel the heat and you feel that this might not be my baby. This might not be something which I should be doing. See, if it was easy it was not something which we needed some skilled professionals to do it. It is not easy. So when you start, when you take a call to upskill yourself, also take a call to stay very focused. Don't let that focus get diluted in that journey of learning. 6 to 8 months to 6 to 10 months is a fair enough time where you will spend your time, energy and your focus to kind of build the right knowledge. And I think to learn anything I think know while in a journey to grow as from a manual testing to a pure automation testing role, I think there are two things which I feel are the key ingredients. One is having the right knowledge where you know what you should learn. Second thing is you should put in the right practice towards it. Whatever you decide to learn, put in the right practice towards it. I might tell you verbally on how to drive a car but that doesn't mean that you will start driving a car. Only when you get inside a car and start practicing it is when you will learn how to drive it and that's where I think the practice becomes very important. So whatever you decide to learn, Java, Python, Selenium or any other tool, ensure you are also in the mindset to put in the right amount of practice and have that patience for about six months with any new technology to kind of let it sink in and let it soak in and you know learn, get up to the part where you start adding a lot of value. I think that's my thought overall. Thank you so much for having me. but yeah that's my last part. Thanks a lot Tushar. I think it was great talking to you. I think I had fun interacting with you. I think hopefully it will be useful. Thanks a lot again for taking time out on a Saturday. Thanks a lot. Thank you so much and wish you all a very good weekend and wish you all a very good learning journey ahead and it was fun having a chat with you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye."

I was looking for something where I can learn and also grow technically as well as personally. I got to know about the Cryo program. I was extremely excited because I knew that it's going to be a learning journey that would take me even more ahead than where I was. The sessions which we had, they were very interactive. The best part about Cryo teaching team was that they used to ask us to discuss. We had an interview practice session. Cryo focuses on a practical approach to learning. It focuses on theory but gives more importance to practical learning. Even the projects that we were given during the assignments and all, all of them were based on real-life scenarios. Through this, at the same time, your ideas are considered, you're taught how to answer and prepare for interviews. Even the teaching material for that matter is extremely good. Everything is structured on the basics. So, a complete and practical approach. approach to learning is what you can expect from the CRIO program."

        "transcription": "Okay so welcome back and in this particular video we will be discussing the problem find next greater number with the same set of digits. So let's try to read the problem statement by discussing the first milestone. The problem is given a positive integer n we have to find the smallest integer which have exactly the same digits existing in the number n but which is greater in the value than n. So just a smaller number but greater than the current number in terms of the same number of digits and if there is no such number present then we have to return or you can say print minus 1 and input will be a 32 bit integer it will be it means that there can be 4 bytes for the current integer that is in C++ it might be int in Java again it might be int in some other languages it will be a standard integral input. output will be a single integer again so if the input is 12 what is the next possible number with the same set of digits 1 & 2. 12 have two digits 1 & 2 but what is the just next greater number for 12 it can be 21 because only these two numbers are possible with the digits 1 & 2 and 21 is greater than 12 but what will happen if the input will be 21 what is the next greater number than 21 with the same set of digits you cannot say 22 because 22 have different set of digits it is 2 & 2. 21 will have the next number as nothing there is no number possible why because for a number greater than 21 we should have certain basically number which is having the either digit 2 more than 2 at the place of 2 there should be a digit more than 2 or at the place of 1 there should be a digit more than 1 but it is not possible you cannot replace those digits so for this we have to print minus 1 is there is no next greater possible answer will be minus one so obviously this was a very small test case with only two digits if there was only one digit what will happen let's say there is only one digit one what will be the next greater number not possible again because for only one digit there is only one number possible so for two digits there can be two scenarios but for three digits there might be different different scenarios so let's go through all the scenarios for three digit number and using that we will come up to the third actually the second milestone that is understanding that what we can do to solve it so for three digit numbers what can be the permutations so if i just give you a number 123 or the digits one two and three so using digits one two and three you can form a number 123 you can form a number 132 and i am showing an increasing order them number of digits is one two three actually three digits but digits are arranged in such a manner so that we are able to get the next next greater number so from 132 next greater will be 213 you can just try to come up with all the permutations on your own you will also be able to get the next greater similarly next will be 231 similarly next will be 312 and finally the last one will be 321 why because for three digits there will be 3 into 2 into 1 6 factorial actually 3 factorial which is 6 number of different kind of ways in which you can arrange those numbers what will happen for 4 digit numbers for 4 digit numbers the possible combinations or the possible permutations will actually increase for now it is 3 factorial but for 4 factorial for 4 digits it will be 24 different kind of scenarios so if it is only 3 digits let's say if the input was 123 what will be the answer next greater number with the same set of digits will be 132 for input as 132 the next possible number with same set of digits which is just greater is for 213 it will be 231 for 231 it should be 312 for 312 it should be 321 but for 321 it should be minus 1 because there is no next greater possible same goes for the 4 number digits also basically a number with a 4 set of digits so if I quickly just write all the 24 possible permutations or the ways in which we can arrange the digits so 1 2 3 4 then 1 2 4 3 then 1 3 2 4 then 1 3 4 2 then you can say 1 4 2 and 3 and then 1 4 3 2 so these are all the possible ways where 1 is the starting digit then similarly 2 can also be the starting digit so we can have 2 1 3 4 then 2 1 4 3 then 2 3 1 4 and 2 3 4 1 and similarly 2 4 3 1 3 and 2 4 3 1 same goes for 3 as a starting digit if 3 is the starting digit what will  happen we can say 3 then it can be 1 2 4 or 3 1 4 2 3 then we can have 2 like although some of you might feel that why I am generating all of this but this problem is going to take some certain observations of certain patterns to observe then only we can solve this problem so 3 1 4 2 next number will be 3 2 then you can say 1 4 then 3 2 4 1 similarly 3 4 1 2 3 4 2 1 and finally last set of digits will be having the numbers starting with 4 so we can have all the numbers like 4 1 2 3 4 1 3 2 4 2 1 3 4 2 3 1 4 3 1 2 and finally 4 3 2 1 actually I am just looking on these numbers so these will be all the possible 24 permutations or 24 arrangements now if input will be 1 2 3 4 output will be 1 2 4 3 if input will be 2 3 4 1 output will be 2 4 1 3 similarly if input will be actually uh are we going correctly yes for input as 4 3 2 1 output will be minus 1 so how we can get the next possible number see if the input is an integer what we can do we can simply run a loop on all the integers greater than the current number let's say the input number was 213 we want to find the next possible number just greater than 213 with the same set of digits so what we can do we can start with 214 is it 214 having the same set of digits no for same set of digits we can maintain a count that how many times 1 is there how many times 2 is there how many times 3 is there 214 is not having the same set of digits what for what will happen for 215 it will also not have same set of digits 216 no 217 and so on so on so on up till we will reach obviously 2312 before 312 there will be no other number the same set of digits but as soon as I reach to 312 this number and this number will have same set of digits so we can say 4 2 1 3 the next possible number with same set of digits and just greater number will be 312 but what will be the time complexity for this particular approach where we are just simply running a loop over all the numbers starting from the current number c if in the input the constraint is the n can be anything from 0 to 10 raised to power 9 n can be anything from 0 to 10 raised to power 9 so n can be maximum you can say like the worst case possible scenario might be it have one then nine zeros and if it will have one then nine zeros then it will have a lot of permutations or a lot of combinations because you have to try for all the numbers maybe let's say 9 2 then let's say maybe 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 for this number if we are generating the next possible permutation so we have to go through all the numbers greater than it and it will actually take a lot of time so in worst case what will be the time complexity we can easily see that if a number is odd of the range 0 to 10 ish by 9 generating all the numbers till n will go order of n in nature that is linear in nature but will it run will it actually get accepted it will actually fail for bigger test cases where their n value is very large approximately equal to 10 ish by 9 although we will not be taking any extra space space will be constant but we are taking a lot of time a linear time can we optimize this and the answer is yes but the solution for the optimization is very tricky this was your brute force but the optimization will be taking a quite bit of pattern finding from the examples so if I take the example 1 2 3 4 what is the next possible number 1 2 4 3 how the two numbers are related we can say that 4 from 4 we are going to 3 we are going to a smaller number if we are going to a smaller number there is a chance that going to the next number we can generate the next greater number by swapping both of them if we are swapping 3 and 4 it will become 4 and 3 because we were decreasing because there was a chance that we can swap these values we can change these values so so that we can make an increasing number we made the number 1 2 4 3 ok what for 1 2 4 3 from 3 to 4 are we going in decreasing order no there is no scope of increasing the number if we will make this 3 if we will make this 4 it will actually decrease the number it will make it 3 4 instead of 4 3 it will decrease we have to make a next greater number for a current number we have to find next greater number with same set of digits so for 4 3 i am not saying that it is a valid pair but for from 4 to i can surely say that yes from going to 4 to 2 we are going to a dip and if we are going to a dip then we can say that we have to do something with 2 we have to replace 2 but should we replace 2 with 4 no we should replace 2 with a just just greater number just greater because we have to form the next set of digits the next basically possible number with same set of digits which is just increasing and if we need just increasing number it shouldn't be not better to replace it with 4 otherwise it will become 1 4 something something 1 4 dash dash but if you are going to replace it with just greater that is 3 it will become 1 3 something something so 1 3 0 0 or you can say 1 4 0 0 which number is just greater 1 3 0 0 is just greater so I will prefer to replace the dip value with a just greater value this was your dip value this was your just greater value we actually swapped them and if we are swapping them it will become 1 3 then you can say 4 2. But is 1 3 4 2 the answer? You know 1 3 4 2 is also not the answer. 1 3 2 4 is the answer. So first thing what we have observed first thing is we have to find a dip that is find a pair i comma i plus 1 find adjacent pair where we are going in a lower value where we are going from a bigger digit to a smaller digit. So find the digit find the dip where once we have find the dip in this case it was 3 because from 4 to 3 we were going decreasing in this case it was 2 the digit 2. Once we have find the dip replace it with just greater value replace this dip with just greater value with just greater value in the left side or in the right side obviously in the right side then only it will basically have next set of numbers if you are going to replace 1 it will actually make very large number it will go in this range or this range or this range we do not have to do anything with the left digits we have to only do with the right set of digits. So replace the digit with just greater in the right side, just greater digit in the right side. Let's say this just greater digit is j. So for first number, what was just greater than 3? It was 4. So we replace 3 with 4. For 2, what is just greater than 2? It was 3. But after replacing it with 3, after swapping it with 3, the number was becoming 1, 3, 4, 2. But the output is 1, 3, 2, 4. So again, a small bit of observation that after swapping what we need, 4, 2 should become 2, 4. That is, I should sort it or I should reverse it. I should either sort it or reverse it. This observation will again be clear if we are going to discuss for some more number. For 1, 3, 2, 4, this was the input. We want to get the next possible number. So where is the first dip? From 4 to 2. Yes, this is a dip. So 2 is the dip number. 2 is the number which can be replaced. By which number should we replace it? Obviously, in the right side, there is only one possible number which is greater, which is 4. So j will be 4. this red number is nothing but I this blue number is nothing but J and once we have figured out this what we need to do swap them so this will become 4 this will become 2 and sort the part after the red number after the dip but there is only one digit so actually this is the next possible number from 1 2 2 4 1 3 2 4 the next number is 1 3 4 2 similarly for this number if this is the input see now from 2 to 4 are we going to a dip no from 4 to 3 yes we are going to a dip so we have found a dip 3 replace it with just greater so for 3 is it 2 just greater no if we are going to replace it with 2 it will become smaller is a 4 just greater yes so we have find the number which we should swap it so 3 should be swapped with 4 so this will become 4 this will become 3 but is this what the output is we have we are getting the number 1 4 3 2 but the output is 1 4 2 3 so actually we have to reverse it or we have to sort it so third part be reversing the array third part will be reverse the array or actually reverse the number reverse the digits because there is no array as such reverse the digit after the i digit after the dip digit that is after the digit i so if we just discuss this for some more numbers if the input is 1 4 2 3 where is the dip from 3 to 2 this is actually decreasing so this is the dip and the swapping will be obviously with 3 only that is 1 4 2 3 will become 1 4 3 2 but the observation will be clear when we are going from this number to the next number see from 2 to 3 is it a dip no from 3 to 4 is it a dip is there any chance so that we can increase this number from 4 3 2 can we increase the number no from 4 3 2 already the digits are in decreasing order we cannot increase it but from 4 to 1 we are decreasing and if we are decreasing there is a chance that we can increase the number so find the dip value if value was 1 the digit one how should we swap it we should swap it with just greater who is just greater it is two so i will swap it with two so just greater is two i will swap it with two so what will be the new number one four three two in which one and two are getting swapped dip i is swapping with just greater j so it is becoming two four three one but is this what the next greater number c no for all the digits after the dip they are four three one but i need one three four so that's why i am saying that it will be better to reverse the digits after the dip and why we are reversing because we need just greater if we are reversing we are making them in increasing order currently they are in decreasing order we need to make them in increasing order so if we have have them in increasing order it will be the smallest possible number increasing digits are smallest possible decreasing digits are greatest possible number so third step will be to reverse the digits after the dip index i that is after the digit I till our last digits all digits will be reversed but is it very easy to find the dip digit then find the just greater digit find the actually reverse the digits after the dip in an integer no it will not be easy to do it in an integer what we can surely do is convert this integer into a character array or into a string whichever language you are using like if you are using Java you have to do it in a character array if you are using maybe C++ kind of language or JavaScript you can do it in a thumb of a string because in once you convert in a string or a character array you will be getting the indices you will be having the indices and based on indices you can do your swapping you can do your reversal very easily so we will be first converting the input integer into a character array or string then doing these three steps once these three steps are done we will leave convert back the character array the output one into back the input what is the time complexity for this approach. See, finding the tip from the right side is nothing but linear because we will just run a simple loop and find a pair i, i plus 1 where array of i or nums of i is smaller than nums of i plus 1. So, linear time. Finding the just greater digit will again be linear because finding a just greater in the right side will again be running a loop and then reversing will again be linear. But linear plus linear plus linear and in terms of what? In terms of n? No. In terms of number of digits. So, if a number is n, what will be the number of digits in a given number? It will be log n. For a given number, number of digits in a given number n will be log of base 10 n. So, time complexity will actually go as a logarithmic. Will there be any extra space? Yes, we are going to create a character array or string. So, it will be again log n due to the extra space because we are storing all the digits in an array. So, number of digits for number 10 to the power 9 how many digits will there be there will be 9 digits 9 is nothing but log of 10 to the power 9 so now with that we have discussed the optimization it is not an intuitive solution but still we will be we are done actually with the second milestone we will be going to the third milestone that is writing the pseudocode or writing the instruction manual so for this what we are doing first of all we need to create a character array so create a character array from the input integer from integer n in java you can first convert the integer into a string using to string and then integer dot to string will be converted into a character array using to char array or in other languages you can accordingly use inbuilt functions whichever are available once we have created a character array let's say array named as digits from the integer input what we need to do find the dip by running a loop. for the i index for over i index from the right side that is from the second last index why second last index because obviously if we need to compare i with i plus 1 i plus 1 should exist next index should exist if we are going to compare 4 with the next number next digit there is no next digit so we should start with the second last digit so run a loop over i index from the second last digit and check what if it is a tip or not if the digit at i index at i index is a smaller than digit at i plus 1 index if the current digit is a smaller then we are having a tip and if we are having a tip we have found it so quick once we have figured out the tip what we need to do find just greater than that number so that we can swap it once the tip is 3 find the just greater number tip is 2 just greater it was 2 just greater so find a just greater number with the index date so find add just greater digit in the right side over j index from the last index actually now from last index because j index can be last also so if digit add j index is greater this time then the digit add i index because it is a just greater digit we can break out once we have figured out both the digits i as well as j once we know what is the dip what is the just greater digit we can swap them so swap the digits that is the array values at i and j respectively once we have swapped what was the third step the third step was nothing but reversing the digits after the dip that is reverse the array using any inbuilt function you can do it reverse the array from i plus one index till last index till last index and then finally obviously we have to return i integer not a character array or a string so what we can do we can convert the integer array or the character array back to the integer so return the character array converted into integer converted into a integer that is if the input was 1, 2, 3, 4 convert it into an array 1, 2, 3, 4 convert it into an array 1, 2, 4, 3 and then convert it back into the integer that is 1, 2, 4, 3 as an integer 1243 so in java you can do it using first of all converting the character array into a string and then from that string you can convert it into integer using in build functions first you can use string dot value of and then you can basically do the conversion of the string correspondingly so now with that are all the cases covered actually no see what will happen if the input will be 4, 3, 2, 1 if input is such a number where next greater does not exist what will we do if we are finding a dip from 1 to 2 is it a dip no from 2 to 3 is it a dip no from 3 to 4 is it a dip no and then there is no more digits so if there is no dip found what should we do the i index should go negative and if i index is going negative it means there is no dip and if it is there is if there is no dip present we should return minus 1 because there is no next greater number so we have to do what if the i index if i index is becoming negative is becoming negative then there is no dip no dip means no next letter present so return minus 1 because answer is minus 1 in that case because it was given in the question itself now with that we have completed the third milestone and now we will be coding this problem by taking the fourth milestone onwards so first of all what we need to do we need to create a integer array digits from the integer n actually a character array digits so char square bracket arr let's say digits is equals to first of all integer should be converted into a string so we can say integer dot to string in java integer dot to string and once it is converted into a string we can convert it into a character array by using to char array function now that we have the array of digits first let's confirm whether we are getting the correct set of digits or not so let me just print the all the digits by using arrays dot to string digits and for now let's return something let's return minus one otherwise it will show me an error so if i run this what should be the output for input as a 12 output should be a array containing two digits one and two yes it is containing array containing two what if the input is one two three four five six out the array should be having six digits one two three four five six it should be the output for now yes it is the output obviously we are not going to return this we are not going to print it so now what we need to do we need to find the dip integer so let's maintain an index i is equals to starting from the second last index that is digits dot length minus 2 second last digit will be the second last index and we need to run the loop till we are not able to find the dip that is till i is greater than equal to 0 and what should we do we should check if digit at i index that is if digit of i is a smaller than digit of i plus 1 then we have found a dip and if we have found a dip what we should do we should basically break out from the loop we have found it once we have found that dip what we need to do we need to check if it is a corner case if dip does not exist if dip is a minus if dip is negative there is no dip present answer is minus 1 there is no basically next greater number possible if next greater is possible then we can just say let's make maintain an index j for it starting from the last index this time that is digits dot length minus one this time because if i is a 3 j can be 4 it can be the last digit also and for it also we have to run a loop we can say while j is greater than equal to 0 actually it will stop in between only but you can run till 0 and check if digit of j is a greater than digit of i so we have found a just greater digit and if we have found we should break out once we will find both the pairs i and j we need to swap them so how we can swap them i will be using an inbuilt function so you can actually use inbuilt function you can write your own code so for now i will be just saying arrays dot swap and in the arrays dot swap we will say pass the digit array and pass the indices which we need to swap that is i index with j index once swapped we will reverse the array from i plus 1 index till the last index and for swapping actually what we need to do for reversing what we need to do we can use an inbuilt function or you can write your own logic so if there is any inbuilt function present in java we can use it directly or let's actually quickly write a code for reverse because we are not sure we actually i am not sure whether there is an inbuilt function for reversing a part of an array that is reversing an array from a given index so i will be passing the array digits i will be passing the range which i want to reverse that is left and right and what we need to do is we need to do the loop till left is smaller than equal to right every time swap the value so array basically actually you can say collections dot swap actually not collections but let's take a temporary variable let's do it swapping on our own so int temp is equal to digits of left digits of left will become digits of right and similarly digits digits of right will become the temp this is how you swap two elements present at left and right index and swapping means reversing means left plus plus right minus minus so what we need to do we need to reverse from the i plus one index till last index that is reverse the digits array from i plus one till last index means digits dot length minus one these two indices should be passed at left and right once we have reversed we can return the basically output but output should be converted into an integer because return type is an integer so what we need to do we need to convert this digits array first of all this array into a string so how to convert a array into a string we can use string dot value of function so string dot value of digits it will convert it into an array of basically into a string actually and using that string how can i get the integer integer value i can just use parsing function that is from the string i can convert it into a corresponding integer so let's see if it is working fine actually there were a lot of things involved what you have to do from your side is just do a dry run one by one line by line then only you will be able to get the logic so run the code why we are not able to see the output let's run it again so it is running for the input 1 2 3 4 5 6 let's see for the input the sample input itself for 12 output output should be 21 if it will work fine so there are certain errors possible lossy conversion most probably so we have done integer we do not have to take integer we have to take actually character like in other languages this reverse function will be inbuilt you can also search for an inbuilt function in java for reverse and there are certain other errors also cannot find symbol digits so this is not digit this should be digits so these kind of syntactical errors happens often similarly here also it should be digits let me just change this as digits this is also digits and let's run it again is there any other errors so character array cannot be converted into object array okay so for swap function actually we can just code the swap on our own that is first take the digits of i make the digits of i become digits of j and make the digits of j become 10 you can use in build function again but i am writing my own code so let's run it again for the sample input certain more issues possible lossy conversion from int to char so here again we have to take char not int let's see if it is working now okay finally in the last line we are having a small error variable digit again it said it is not digit it is digits or array of digits So for the input 12 we are getting output as 21 for input 1 2 4 3 what is the output for input 1 2 1 2 4 3 output should be 1 3 2 4 let's see if it is giving me 1 1 3 2 4 or not. So it is running I don't know why it is taking a lot of time but most probably it should work it should be giving me the correct output actually timeout we are getting so there might be certain other issues which we are facing we are first of all having a i index while i is greater than equal to 0 if digits of i is smaller than digits of i plus 1 then we have to break out then if index is negative return minus 1 otherwise figure out the j index if digits of j is more than digits of i then we have found a just greater we can break out we can just swap. the digits at i and j once we have swapped we can reverse in the reversal part are we doing it correctly we are taking the digits at left digits at left will become digits at right right will become next temp left plus plus right minus minus this is also correct and after the reversal finally we are converting the digits array into a string and string back to integer and let's see like what is happening by actually having a system dot out at println after the second part after the second while loop so i think i have found the mistake we are not doing i minus minus like even before doing a dry run we are not doing i minus minus here similarly we are not doing j minus minus here because we need to run the loop in decreasing order from the right side we have to find the indices so let's run it again to see if now it is working yes let's submit now to see if it will work for all test cases yes it is working so a code was like a kind of an non-intuitive problem because you cannot without any observation without any pattern directly say that you have to apply reversal you have to apply sorting or swapping but once you see this optimization once you see this pattern you can easily code this if you remember the codes of how to reverse or how to swap. So the problem was taking linear time complexity in terms of the number of digits that is in terms of the number itself it will be taking logarithmic time and since we are taking a character array it will be taking logarithmic space also and apart from diamond space is there any follow-up which you can solve surely it is if the question was directly give me the next greater permutation in terms of array or a string how you can solve it instead of an integer or maybe next previous number like actually previous number which is just a smaller that can be also so try to think in terms of that Till then, let's meet in the next video. Bye-bye everyone. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.  you"

        "transcription": "Boku wa kochi piya ston Hey, how does Netflix stream so much content for so many people without a hitch? Well, actually... Netflix's back-end relies heavily on Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime environment. But how has Node.js helped Netflix? First, scaleability. Node.js manages thousands of connections simultaneously. It's important for a service where millions of users stream content at the same time. Next, event-driven, non-blocking IO. Let's say if you're watching an episode of Friends, and Person B wants to watch an episode of Brokel 99. Now, Netflix allows both of you to watch it parallelly, thanks to Node.js, that it doesn't have to wait for you to finish the episode of Friends and then let the other person watch the Brokel 99 episode. And that's where, when the new season of Squid Game drops, everyone will be able to watch it at the same time, without a hitch."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video, we will be discussing the problem determine the capacity of the largest container. The problem is saying you are given an array and size which is containing non-negative integer. So array at least having some elements each of those elements are positive that is non-negative at least greater than equal to 0 where each element represents the height of a line. So each element will be representing the height of a vertical line and vertical lines are drawn at points marked 1 to n as you can see in the image 1 2 3 4 up till up till n and is the array size on the x-axis find two lines which together with the x-axis forms a container find two lines which together forms a container along with the x-axis that is the horizontal line and the container. should hold the most amount of water assume the width of the lines to be negligible so we have to assume the water should be as a plane only or you can say it should be one the volume will be length into breadth into one so we only have to consider 2d area and not 3d area that is what is it it is mentioned in the assumption we have to assume 2d area and you have to not slant the container that is you cannot basically take any edges or maybe take any diagonals or maybe take any any kind of slanting you have to take vertical or the horizontal line horizontal should be the x-axis verticals are what is given and n will be at least 2 it means there will be at least 2 heights given there will be at least 2 vertical bars given input format as you can clearly see is array n size containing n elements each element will be positive because height should be positive and the values corresponding to each of the array elements So for this sample input 186 and so on, there is one input also given 18625 and so on. So let's do what let's actually bring our bring the sample input only in what in the nodes so we are taking a screenshot for the sample input and we will bring this screenshot and accordingly we will make a diagram and we will see how we can actually form the maximum area container so there are some bars let me make the grid so that we can make the bars easily okay so first grid will be our first vertical line will be of one height next vertical line will be actually let me make it from below this is one height this is one two then three four five six seven eight height then next height will be six so So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, it will be visible after I will remove the grid, don't worry. And then after 6, it will be 2 height after 2, it will be 5 height as given in the sample input. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, height, then after 5, it will be 4. Then after 4, it will be again 8 after 8, it will be 3 after 3, it will be 7. This is the sample input. Let me just remove the grid. This is the heights given and the x-axis is always you can say at 0. And let's say I'm marking the heights also below. This is 1 height, this is 8 height, this is 6 height, this is 2 height, this is 5 height, this is 4 height, this is 8, this is 3, and this is 7. And we have to form the maximum area container, which according to the answer is 89, sample output is 89. And what is that area? Area is 7 into 7. We have to actually. not 7x7. Yeah, it is 7x7 which is the lines 8 and 7 that is first line with 8 height and second line with 7 height. These two heights and the length will be actually the distance between them and distance between them is 7. So 7 is the length, 7 is the height, area will be 49 and that is what they are saying is the maximum. Why I can't take 8 height and 7 length because the water will overflow from here. You only have to take that much height whichever the lower bar is set at. If there is a left bar at 8 height, right bar at 7 height, you cannot take the water at 8 height because water will overflow from here. So although it is not mentioned in the question that we have to take care about overflow but it is self-explanatory that we have to only take the height between the bars. It should be mentioned somewhere, it is between the bars. Find the two lines which together forms with the x-axis a container. container means the water cannot overflow container means the height of the container should be equal to the water height so how we can actually solve this how we can figure out the two bars or two vertical lines which will form together a container see a brute force solution can be to figure out all such pairs of bars brute force will be find first bar and then after finding first bar find the second bar find all pairs of bar example is if i am taking first bar as the height one if i am taking second bar as height eight what is the amount of water i can store i can only store amount of water with height one only and what about length the length will be one by the distance between one and zero will be one minus zero it will be one so one into one what is the maximum amount of water till now the maximum amount or you can say answer will be zero and now it is one one into one to be precise then if the first bar is one second bar is six Again, what is the maximum height I can only store one only why because the water will overflow if I will make the height increase from one and what will be the length length will be 2 minus 0 which will be 2 so 2 into 1 it is better so update the answer then what about this one along with this one it will be again 1 into 3 so 1 into 3 will be 1 better then 1 into 4 then 1 into 5 then 1 into 6 if I am taking the second height at this even though the second height is 8 but I can still take the height of water as 1 only the minimum 8 only 1 into 7 and finally 1 into 8 maximum will actually go as 1 into 8 if the first bar is taken as 1 height what if the first bar is taken as the height 8 in that case if the second bar is taken as height 6 what is the amount of water I can store in between them the height will be 6 only the minimum of the and the length will be the distance between them that is 2 minus 1 what is the formula the formula of area. will be let's say the left bar is left l let's say the right bar is right r let's say for now i am taking this as left this is r what is the amount of water which i can store between them i can say the height of water between them will be the minimum of l of r so minimum of l comma r and what will be the length between them the length between them will be the distance between those two bars that is the indices the difference between the indices so l and r will be the values actually so we can say array of l comma area for the minimum height into the distance and distance will be r minus left that is r minus l that is five uh fifth uh five value having fourth index six value having second index so eight uh four minus two which is actually not eight but two four minus two is two that is the distance between them is two and what will be the height the height will be the minimum of six comma five the values minimum the heights minimum so minimum will be five so if i take the left bar as height 6 right bar as height 5 with a distance 2 the amount of water I can store between them will be 2 into 5 which is 10 and this way I will figure out all such pairs so what will be the maximum pair according to the question according to the question the maximum pair will be nothing but the height with uh left height at 8 right height at 7 why why not right height at 8 only because only increasing the height will not increase the area increasing the length also will increase the area not only this but this also will increase it will result in increasing the area and hence increasing the amount of water so if I take these two pairs these two elements in the pair what will be the distance between them it will be 8 minus 1 7 and what will be the minimum of 7 it will be 7 so it will be 7 into 7 that is what the maximum is but if I would have taken this bar as the right height this bar as a left height so minimum of 8 comma it will be 8 only if you can store 8 amount of water 8 height of water actually what will be the distance between them 6-1 only 5 so 5 into 8 will be 40 so 49 is better than 40 so I will take 49 only so that's why the strategy is not only increasing the height obviously height increasing is one thing but the strategy is also increasing the distance between them so that was the brute force solution what will be the time complexity of brute force as you can clearly see that I will take the first element then second element as all the remaining then first element as a second bar remaining all the bars as second bar that is nested loop so nested loop will require order of n square time complexity two loops will be required n square time what about space it will actually not require any extra space because we can just maintain the answer variable as an integer and figure out all such pairs but the question is can we do it better and answer is yes we can do it better see what is the objective the objective as you can clearly see is increasing the area we want the maximum area but in order to increase the area we can increase the length or we can increase the height length into height if we are saying and breath we are taking as one or we can say width we are taking as one only negligible so in order to increase area we are increasing length or height height is not in our control why because height is given in the array already but what is in our control it can be the length what we can do we can try to take the maximum distant apart bars the bars with the most distance so initially what i will assume i will assume the first bar the left bar which i am taking is at the zeroth index the right bar which i am taking is at the eighth index that is the two bars with the maximum distance why it will help me if i will take the maximum distance the area will increase it might be having lesser height example one height only but i will try to improve it in terms of height first i have taken the maximum length although the height might be the minimum but I will try to balance both I will try to go to a certain point where length will also be good enough height will also be good enough and the area will also be good enough that is a maximum so currently what is the area currently area will be 8 minus 0 as a distance 8 minus 0 as a distance and the height will be minimum of 7 comma 1 what is minimum of 1 comma 7 or 7 comma 1 it will be one only you can only store one height so 1 into 7 1 into actually 8 will be how much 8 into 1 will be 8 only so for now the maximum area will be 8 the answer variable initially will be 0 and I will update it to 8 because current height is 8 but now I should try to optimize with the height I should try to increase the height if I want to try to increase the height should I discard the height 1 or should I discard the height 7 this is a very good question actually see what will happen if I am saying the 1. If I am taking the same left bar I am taking the same if I am making the right bar equal to the previous bar I am decreasing the height because I am decreasing the distance because I want to increase the height if I want to increase the height I have to decrease that distance that is why I am making both the pointers shifted towards each other. So if I will make the right pointer go to the previous indexed the right pointer is having height 3 but the left pointer is still having height 1 what will be the minimum? Minimum will be 1 comma 3 it will be 1 only so no change in the area there will be no change in the area if I will discard the right value that is higher height if I will discard higher height and keep the smaller height as it is do not discard it the area will remain same why because the constraint is on the smaller height only even if I take the pair 1 comma 3 the distance will decrease also the height will remain same so overall area will increase the height will remain comma 3 will be 1 again minimum of 1 comma 7 was also 1 1 comma 3 will also be 1 so no need to discard the higher height better will be to discard the smaller height so that there might be a chance where the height is increased so in order to decrease the smaller height currently the smaller height was on the left because it was 1 it was 7 so better to discard the smaller height and make left less all the distance will decrease but there is a chance of height getting increased what is that area now area will be 8 minus 1 that is the length the distance between the bar into the minimum of 8 comma 7 and minimum of 8 comma 7 will be 7 only so 7 into 7 will be 49 and that is what the maximum was so although if i will try to find out more such pairs we will not be able to but let's do what let's just change one of the values let's just make this also 8 height and let's try again so in that case might be be there might be a scenario where 7 minus 1 is 6 6 into 7 actually 6 into 7 will not give me distance which is better than 49 but let's do what let's make it 9 it might be giving me better let's make it 9 and this is 9 instead of 3 what will happen let's see I am saying what left is having height 8 right is having height 7 should I discard the left height or should I discard the right height the question is if left height was discarded will I get any benefit the answer is no even if I make the 8 height become 100 even if the next height was 100 there will be a minimum of 7, 100 as 7 only the lower height is what is determining the answer determining the overall height of water minimum of 8, 7 was 7 minimum of 100, 7 will also be 7 minimum of 6, 7 will also be 7 so better will be not to discard the higher height again discard the smaller height and in this case now smaller height is on the right side previous case smaller right was on the left now in this case smaller height is on the right side so i will discard the smaller right and how can i discard the right side height by making right minus minus what is the current possible pair answer it will be distance seven minus one and the height is minimum of eight comma nine minimum of eight comma nine will be eight only so six into eight what is the distance what is the overall area area it 48 it is not better than 49 so we will not better we will not update the answer but still what should i do again should i discard the eight height or should i discard nine height will discarding nine height give any benefit no actually discarding the higher height will not give any benefit discarding the smaller height might give a benefit might not be but might give so now what is the area area will be seven minus two seven minus two that is that is a distance into minimum of six comma nine so minimum of six comma nine will be 6 only so 5 x 6 very less height only 30 like not better than the previous side again discard the smaller one that is discard the left height I will do left plus plus left initially was at 0 then it came at 1 similarly right initially was at last index now it is at 7th index 2, 9 minimum will be 2 distance will be 7 minus 3 4 4 x 2 will be only 8 like no better answer so this way we will keep on doing the work till obviously the distance between the bars is zero or you can say both the bars become same or till the point left pointer is smaller than right pointer till only that point we will run the loop and as soon as it is done we will stop so since we were able to increase the length as well as height together our length we first took the distance farthest points that is leftmost and the rightmost point that is farthest distance and we try to increase the height also by discarding is a smaller height value if left was having smaller right value left was discarded if right was having smaller right value right was discarded so this was the two-pointed technique what will be the overall time complexity of this approach since we only require two pointer one pointer from left to right another point from right to left either of the pointers are moving and in total both pointers will meet at certain point that is they will traverse the entire array together so it will be order of n time complexity what about space we will not require any extra space only answer variable four bytes is required so constant space so linear time constant space solution a very optimized solution better than the brute force which we discussed now we will be doing the instruction manual milestone number three we are done with the second milestone so first line as already written is initialize a answer integer as zero integer as zero and finally obviously return the answer it is already written in java it might be written in another language also but we have to initialize the answer the maximum area zero and return whatever the maximum area finally will be we have to consider two pointers initialize two pointers or maybe you can say set left as zero and right as n minus one where n is the array dot length it is self-explanatory we have to run this two pointer till the point what till the point left is a smaller than right so run a loop run a loop till left is smaller than right left is a smaller than right what we have to do inside the loop we have to check what is the area right now so set area as what set area as the formula which we discussed that is minimum of the array of left or you can say the height at left comma the height at right the minimum of the heights into the distance between them and what will be the distance the distance between right and left bars will be right minus left that is a positive distance So, set the area as the minimum height into the distance, check if this is the maximum area or not. So, we can say answer will be set as set answer as the maximum of answer till now of the current answer or the current height or the current area you can say not the height but area whatever is maximum. So, answer till now that is 0, 0 where is the dry run, 0 versus 8, 8 is better, 8 versus 49, 49 is better, 49 versus 48, 49 is better. So, whatever is better store that and what we have to do, if the left height is smaller, if the height of left is smaller than height of right, we have to discard the smaller height. So, discarding smaller height means we have to do left plus plus in this case, then do left plus plus. Otherwise, if right height is smaller, so how we can discard the right height, we can make it go to the leftwards direction. is right minus minus so this will be a simple two-pointer logic in linear time complexity that was all about the third milestone we will code the instruction manual that is convert the code in write the code in java actually and also figure out some corner cases if there are any and time and space complexity so we have already initialized the answer as zero which will require us to basically calculate the maximum area we will initialize two pointers left as zero right as array dot length minus one n minus one and we will run this two-pointer logic only till the point the left pointer is smaller than right pointer why because as soon as left becomes equal to right the height the distance between the left and right will become zero or as soon as the left pointer becomes more than right the distance will become negative so no need to take negative distance so what will be the area as discussed in the approach video the area will be the minimum of the left height comma right height first take the height as the minimum while because if I will take the maximum the water will overflow we have to take the smaller bar as the height reference and the distance between them will be right minus left keep on doing this area calculating the area and storing the maximum so answer will be the maximum of the answer till now and the area current area after setting the area you have to update the left pointer or the right pointer accordingly if left height is smaller than left should be discarded so if height of left is smaller than height of right we can discard the left value by making the left pointer plus plus because left pointer is going towards the right side otherwise we have to discard the right pointer by making a right pointer minus final the code is complete let's run the code and see what is the output which we are getting and then we will see if there any if there is any corner case or not so it is taking some time for the sample input it is giving me 21 for this input let's take the sample input one more sample input actually and let's just run it to see if it is going to give me 49 or not it should give me 49 let's see and it is taking some time to run actually and it is giving me 49 let's do what let's just print the area to see if what we were getting in the dry run is what we are getting in the output also and in the dry run we changed the height 3 with height 9 let's see it should give me actually height 8 49 48 30 and so on these should be the areas actually not the heights but areas 8 49 48 30 and so on yes it is giving me the same height and it is updating correctly as part so let's just remove the debugging line and let's just submit it so we have already discussed the time and space complexity in the approach video what was the time since we are running a simple 1d loop where every time either left plus plus or right minus minus is happening a linear time journalist it will be required and since we are not taking any extra data sector any auxiliary data sector constant space will be required so linear time constant space order of n time order of 1 space will be required that was all about the problem determine the capacity of the largest container we have coded it so with that we have done the fourth and fifth milestone we will meet in the next video where we will discuss a new problem till then bye bye take care."

        "transcription": "One tip which I would like to give is to learn how to think like a programmer, not just learn any language, the syntax and everything. Understand whatever the things inside code are, are like tools. So for example, if I tell you to build a door, what are the tools that you're going to need? That thing should come to your mind, that thinking we need to develop. If you develop that, any language you pick up, all you need to do is think for the tool and you just have to Google what tool's name is this. That's all. Just understand how to think like that, for example, if I tell someone to print 10 lines, the first thing that would come in my mind, like a programmer, would be write a for loop. So that tool that is in my head, that wiring in the head, how to think like that, I feel like that's the most key important, because that is going to help in the longer, in the job also. For example, if any new challenge comes, just because I understood what are the tools and I just had to get familiar with them. So like that tip I would give myself."

        "transcription": "Hello everyone, welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem merge overlapping intervals. So what we are given in this problem is we are given a interval or not just a single interval but a range of interval what is the interval interval is nothing but a range that is having a starting value and an ending value if let's say a range is defined as 1,3 it means the range is starting at 1 or the interval is starting at 1 and the interval is ending at 3 and the such kind of intervals will be given in an array a lot of intervals will be given in a collection given a collection of intervals what we have to do is we have to merge all of them but merge overlapping intervals so what is merging overlapping intervals That we will figure out later on but first let's read the problem statement completely. The result should only have one result should only have not one but should only have mutually exclusive intervals. Now it is mutually exclusive intervals the intervals such that no number should be common between two intervals that is they should be non-overlapping they should not overlap they should not have any point of time which is common in two intervals after we are merging them. So the merge intervals should be printed in increasing order of the starting value. Another note is the merge intervals should be printed in increasing order of the starting value. Now let's actually discuss some example to actually understand that what is merging. So given four intervals that is the array size having four first interval is from 1 to 3 second interval is from 2 to 6 third interval is from 8 to 10 the fourth interval  is from 15 to 18 after merging these four intervals merging the overlapping part the non-overlapping intervals finally will be from 1 to 6, 8 to 10, 15 to 18 let's figure out how so first interval let's just make a range from 1 to 3 this is an interval starting from 1 going to 3 next interval is from 2 to 6 as mentioned in the question so let me just make a interval starting from 2 going till 6 what about next next interval is from 8 till 10 so if I draw a line from 8 till 10 this is what will get formed from 8 till 10 and finally last interval is from 15 till 18 so it will be from here let's say till here which is 15 till 18 after merging them as you can see the first and the second interval that is from 1 to 3 and 2 to 6 are having some common part so what we have to do we have to merge them merge overlapping ones and after merging them the final interval will be starting from the earlier start point going till the later ending point that is from 1 till 6 will be the most interval after merging by yellow and the green intervals what about red is a red interval overlapping with these two intervals no there is no overlapping portion this is ending at 6 this is starting at 8 so no overlapping portion so 8 to 10 will be in the output directly what about 15 to 18 again no overlapping portion they have a distance between them so 15 to 18 will be taken in the output directly but the point is how we can merge overlapping intervals or how to figure out the overlapping intervals at the first place see if two intervals for now let's take only two intervals if two intervals are overlapping it means they will have some common portion and how we can check whether they have some common portion we can say If the first interval is starting from 1 and second interval is starting from 2 which interval is starting earlier the first one that is from 1 if this interval is starting earlier but if it will end later than the second interval starting point it means if this is ending at 3 but the other interval is starting at 2 itself it can assume or we can say that both the intervals are overlapping why because if it is starting earlier but ending later than the second interval starting point of course they have some overlapping portion they have some portion which are common between both of them and not necessarily that the first interval will be the smaller interval or you can say with the smaller starting point it can be vice versa also like the order of the input is not given we can have the intervals in input in any order so let's suppose this is the first interval this is the second interval in that is also what we will say. First of all, figure out the interval with a smaller starting point. This is the interval with smaller starting point, the second one in this case. Is it ending later after than the other interval's starting point? Yes. Three is more than two. So again, this is a overlapping portion. But this is a partial overlap. It is not necessary that the two intervals will have a partial overlap. Actually, there are three scenarios. There can be no overlap at all. Like the way we have first interval is let's say this second interval is let's say this. This is from one to five. This is let's say from six to ten. So no overlap among them. Second case is partial overlap. As you can see in the case in the first case itself, that is one of the intervals is let's say one till five. Second interval is let's say three till eight. So these are having partial overlap between three to five. But there is one more case, which is complete overlap. And we have to take care of that scenarios as well. What does complete overlap means? It can have two different things. Let's say the first interval is this second interval is completely inside the first one. It can be like this like the first one is from 1 to 10 second is one is from 2 till 5. So this interval is completely inside the first one. So it is a complete overlap or it can be vice-versa the first interval can be completely inside the second interval, but Should we say overlap only when the two intervals have some range overlapping when the range is common between two intervals. What should we assume if let's say the first interval is from 1 till 5 second interval is directly starting from 5 itself and ending at let's say 10. How about these two intervals should we consider them overlapping should we consider point overlap to be actually overlap or not. So although it is not mentioned in the sample input, but if I will take the second sample input the first interval is from 1 to 4 second interval is from 4 to 5. So these two intervals intervals only intersect only have common portion of a point of a point time which is 4 and in the output as you can see it is merged it is only having 1 till 5 1 to 4 4 to 5 merge becoming 1 to 5 it means if these two intervals are there even a point overlap will be considered a overlap that is point overlap in this case also we have to merge it and make it become 1 to 10 so in this case the output will be 1 to 10 in this case also the output will be 1 to 10 because the second interval is completely inside first in this case the output will be 1 till 8 that is the smaller starting point till greater ending point and in this case of course the output will have the same input that is two intervals as it is no overlap is there so there can be four such scenarios no overlap partial complete or just a point overlap but the point is there are not just two intervals there are multiple intervals and if there are multiple intervals we have to take care of all of them not just intersect or not just figure out between two so one of the brute force can be just figure out all the intervals one by one and try to check whether it can be merged with any one of them or not but this procedure will be repeated a lot of times till the point you are not able to merge any two like you will start with four intervals let's say and they are given in any random order let's say this is the first one this is the second one this is the third one this is the fourth one they can be given in any random order what you will do is you will try to take one interval and try to merge it with other ones then try to take the second one try to merge it with other ones and so on and in order to do this the time complexity will might go into exponential nature why because you don't know that how many times you need to merge two intervals or not so it can go to exponential and the approach or the code in order to do this will also be very complex better will be. figure out some ordering between the random interval and try to merge it with other ones because in input random order is given. Let's just sort the intervals but how should we sort the interval so that we are getting intervals in some particular order and we should take that order and check whether to merge or not. That ordering can be based on the starting point of the intervals that is we can just sort all of them on their starting or we can also sort all of them on the ending points you can do it in any fashion the code or the approach will slightly differ what I am going to do is I am going to sort all the intervals based on the starting point although in the sample input all of these intervals are already sorted on starting point 1 2 8 15 but it it is not necessary it can be anything so let's just do what let's take one more test case where all the four scenarios as we discussed are there so let's take the first interval let's take the second interval like this let's take the third interval like this let's take the fourth interval maybe we can say like this and let's take the fifth interval like this so these are some intervals and let let me just add one more interval so that in the output there are few number of intervals present so this is one more interval let me give some ranges this is let's say 1 till 5 let's say this is 2 till 10 let's say this is 10 till 20 this is let's say 15 till 18 let's say this is 25 till 30 let's say this is 32 till 35 so these are some ranges given and we need to merge them and as discussed if we have intervals in the sorted form on the basis of starting point we will be able to take one interval one by one and check whether to merge it or not so we can easily just sort all of the intervals based on starting point using the comparators. If you know about comparators, you will easily be able to sort them. So I am just making all of these intervals in the order of their starting point. That is, this is the first one. This is the second one, third one, fourth one, fifth one, sixth one. Now, one by one, we will take them in the output, whether we will take them as it is or whether we will merge it with other ones. So first interval, should we take it or should we merge it with any other interval? There is no interval in the output. The first interval we can take as it is, that is, from 1 to 5, we will take it as it is. Done. Second one, it is starting at 2. What is the last interval in the output? It was ending at 5. If the last interval was ending at 5, current interval is starting at 2, it means there is an overlap. And if there is an overlap, they should get merged. So do not just push a new interval 2, 10. Instead of pushing a new interval, update the previous interval's ending point. Why? because once these are merged, the most interval will start from 1 go till 10. So second one is also inserted we can say because it is merged with the first one. Now take the third one. It is starting at 10. What was the previous interval ending at? Also 10. Point overlap. According question, point overlap should be considered overlap. That is, they should be merged even if there is a point overlap. So if we are merging it, the new interval will become 1 till 20. That is a maximum value of the ending point. Now next fourth interval. It is starting at 15. What is the previous interval ending at 20? It means there is again overlap. This is the overlap, the entire overlap. In this case, this point overlap was there. So if there is overlap, we have to merge it. Previous interval ending at 20. Current interval starting at 15. 20 is more than 15. It means there is some portion. But should we update the ending point as the current interval ending point 18? Like this is what we were doing. Initially it was 2. updated it to 5 or actually you can say it was initially 5 we updated it to 10 then after 10 we updated it to 20 but now should we update it to a smaller value 18 after merging this one with this one will it have ending at 18 only no it will have ending at the maximum value the 20 value so this time we will not update the ending point this time ending point will remain 20 because 20 itself is more than 18 18 is smaller than 20 although it is having 15 less than 20 but 18 also is less than 20 that is this is a complete overlap case in complete overlap case just simply discard this interval now next interval fifth interval this is done we have merged it just discarded it this fifth interval is starting at 25 the last interval in the output was starting or you can say ending at 20 so previous interval ended at 20 current interval starting at 25 there is a gap if there is a gap they are non-overlapping so just simply push the current interval the output that is 25 till 30 since we are pushing in the output we don't know what will be the number of intervals in output we can't be sure how many intervals will be there next one sixth 32 till 35 so it is starting from 32 last interval in the output was ending at 30 again there is a gap of two so no overlap no overlap means just push it in the output so 32 till 35 will get pushed in the output finally in the output you can see there are only three intervals and this is the merged form of intervals and this is how we have to do it so first thing just sort all the intervals based on starting point what will be the time complexity required if there are n intervals n ranges it will take n log n in best optimized manner using merge sort quick sort or something and then running a for loop on every interval checking whether to merge it or not will take linear time only why because running a loop will be linear and checking whether it should too much or not it is such a simple if-else condition so overall time will be n log n due to sorting itself all the sorting line will be a single line but time complexity will be dominated or will be recognized by the most amount of time whichever operation is taking that is done by sorting itself what about space since we are going to take extra space since we are going to create a array list or a dynamic array because we don't know how many intervals will be there there will be order of n extra space required although if you want you can do it in place also for that what you have to do is you have to just run the loop twice first to figure out the number of merged overlapping interval that is there are three intervals in this case so just first count the number of resultant interval and then do it to store all of them but that will be a little bit hectic in terms of the code so what we are going to do is we are going to take extra space just to reduce the number of times we are running iterations so now let's go to the instruction manual first step what we need is we have to sort all the intervals so sort all intervals on the basis of starting point on the basis of starting point and how we are going to sort it using comparator how we can sort it using comparator we can say that in Java or in any language except CC++ the comparators should return minus one when we are not swapping it should return plus one when we want to swap it should return zero when both the values are same so using comparator how we can compare we have to compare using the starting value in a given array there are two values zeroth index first index zeroth index having the starting point first index having the ending point we need to sort on the starting points it means the zeroth index so comparator will be comparing on both the intervals using the starting point that is it will return minus one or you can just simply say return the value of since we need increasing order return the current interval or the first interval starting point minus the second interval starting point this is also known as this minus other return the first interval starting point first intervals starting point starting point minus the second interval starting point this is what we have to apply in the comparator logic so for this problem actually you will require a prerequisite of comparators because if you don't know comparators this reason that why we are doing first minus second or why we are doing minus one in the case of no swap plus one in the case of swap and zero in the case of equal values you will not be able to get it once we are able to sort all the intervals based on the starting point that is first interval with the smallest starting point next greater next greater and so on we will maintain a output data structure so create a arrow list or you can say create a dynamic array so if you are like coding in other languages other than java you will actually have something like vector or something like arrow list so create an arrow list or a dynamic array resultant which will contain all the intervals of the interior array of the intervals containing intervals so initially it will be empty but one by one one by one we will keep on storing the interval in the output array so for that we will start from the first interval that is run a loop a run a for loop over all the intervals one by one we will take one interval at a time and check whether to merge it or not so how to check whether to merge it or not if the last interval either it is not there is not there or we can say the last intervals last intervals ending point is more than the current interval starting point then there is a portion of overlap and if there is a portion of overlap then we have to merge it but in the case of last interval is not over present actually we have to not merge because if last is not present we can't merge it so what we can first take is whether when to not merge so we have to not merge when the last interval is not present at all then we can't merge or when we when the current interval starting point is more than the last intervals ending point or you can say last intervals ending point is lesser than current interval starting point currents starting point if it is the case we do not have to merge in this case we have to add the current interval in the output so add the current interval in the output because we are not merging it we are saying is for the first interval since the previous interval does not exist. Do not merge it. Just directly add in the output for this interval since the previous intervals ending point is lesser than the current intervals starting point do not merge it add it in the output do not merge it add it in the output these two scenarios we have to add in the output that is do not merge non-overlapping otherwise if it is overlapping then we have to update the last intervals ending point update last quarter as well as ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** your So update the last intervals ending point as the maximum of last intervals ending point last or currents ending point so this is what we have to do and finally since we need to return the array in a static array form so we have to just convert dynamic array into a static array by running a for loop you can easily do it just transfer all the values all the intervals from the array list into the array or you can say vector into a simple static array and then return the array then return the static array so this is what we have to do in order to solve this problem although the code will be very less but the logic was more important and as already discussed time complexity will be n log n space complexity will be linear this will be the problem merge overlapping intervals we will write the code for the problem we will be writing it in java programming language first of all what we need is we can't just apply the algorithm without all the intervals being sorted this is a greedy algorithm and for it we actually need all the intervals to be sorted on the based on starting point so for that we have to apply the comparison logic then we can use angular the arrow operator and then after that operator we can use the curly brackets this will represent a comparator using lambda expression we are actually using a lambda expression to construct or to determine how we have to compare two arrays or two intervals two arrays will be of size to each that is having two elements 0 to index having the starting point first index having the ending point that is a is an array of two size b is an array of two size and we need to sort it in increasing order based on starting point so we need to return what we need to return a of 0 minus b of 0 because starting point is at the 0th index this is how the sorting will work for the array of interval let us write it in one single line because it is just a matter of comparator a one line comparator actually so once we are able to basically write this comparator logic what we need to do is we need to for confirmation we can just for now print the array so system.out.println arrays.toStringIntervals let us print all the intervals and for now let us return the same intervals array itself because otherwise returning will give you a missing return statement error so hopefully the syntax is correct although there is no such syntax maybe what we have to do is we have to remove the curly bracket because there is only one line of return statement we can just omit the curly brackets also there is no need of curly brackets although if you will be requiring to return minus 1 plus 1 then in that case you have to basically have curly brackets because there will be more than one line of code so as you can see like the objects are getting printed actually we have to print all the intervals not the objects but we can assume that all the intervals are being sorted correctly now once all the intervals are sorted what we need to do we need to create a dynamic array so array list is nothing but a dynamic array in Java of array of 1d array 1d array will be a interval having two elements let's say this is resultant and we need to basically have it initialized with empty array list in ht we will keep on getting one one interval at a time so we will run a loop over all the intervals we can run a for each loop for that so we will get one interval at a time and we will ask whether to merge this interval or whether to basically added that is consider it as non-overlapping or overlapping when should it be considered non-overlapping if the output does not contain anything so we can get the last interval in a variable that will be last named as last you can get it in a variable and you can just say in the resultant get the last index get the resultant dot size minus one index but as discussed that it can happen that last interval is not existing that is the size zero so if the resultant dot size is zero in that case just take it null for now otherwise null pointer exception will be there now we need to check if last interval is not present it means it is null or we can say if the last interval's ending point is smaller than current interval starting point last interval ending point means first index because ending point is at first index starting point is at zeroth index is smaller than current interval starting point it means it is non-overlapping and if it is non-overlapping we should add the current interval in the output and how we can add it we can just say in the resultant just add the current interval that's it add the current interval although the current interval is named as interval let's name it curr that is current but if it is overlapping we have to merge it merging means just updating the end index and we will make it updated at last of one that is the ending index of the last interval will be maximum of math dot max of two parameters which two maximum either the same value that is the ending index of the last interval or the current intervals ending index or the current intervals ending point once we are able to just insert all of these intervals in the resultant we can't just return resultant why because return type required is a static array but we have a dynamic array so we have to convert the arrow list into the array by running a for loop simple so we can create a dynamic array let's say we are naming it as answer we can't name it same is equal to new in square bracket square bracket first dimension will be nothing but number of rows in this arrow list or you can say number of intervals which is nothing but result dot size and the second parameter will be nothing but each interval having how much size each interval will have two elements starting point ending point so second dimension will be two and we can now just store all the values by running an index loop is starting from zero going till answer dot length and we can just make all the intervals stored in the static array so answer of index will be the result dot get in there yet is the function for error list square bracket is the way for array this is the difference in the syntax in Java and now we can return the answer not the error list because answer is that static array so if I will run this code hopefully should give me all the intervals in sorted order in merged form because in the version it was mentioned we have to print them in increasing order of starting value that is why we have done the sorting and also in order to apply the logic sorting is required because if we have not sorted the starting points we can't just say that we should compare the current interval with the last interval last interval will only be there uh if it is sorted or you can say last interval will be adjacent only if it is sorted so it is taking some time to run i'm not sure why it is taking that much time let's wait for the output to come hopefully the code is correct let's till that point maybe go through all the code so first of all we are sorting all the intervals based on starting point then we are having an error list then we are running a loop over all the intervals we are getting the last interval if the last interval does not exist take it null otherwise take it at the last index if last interval does not exist or it it is not over overlapping then what we have to do we have to just simply add the current interval that's it otherwise update the last intervals ending point has the maximum of both the values so this is also working fine like I think it is I should it should work fine we have created an array of answers and we are just storing all the values now there is some small error result dot add interval is not there it is current the current interval is named as C so let's run it again and see it might take that much time again I'm not sure but hopefully it should be correct now yes as you can see the sample input is working let's just submit it and as discussed all the point overlap no overlap complete overlap all the corner cases are getting accepted what is the time complexity of this entire program we can say first we are sorting all the intervals let's say there are n intervals so sorting will require n log n time because it is using the most optimized fashion of sorting and just then running a loop over all the intervals checking whether to merge or not this is linear only so overall time complexity will be n log n plus n plus n which is n log n in big O notation and what about space since we are requiring a list which is not in the input not in the output so there is extra space of linear space complexity why because second dimension is just two there are two columns for each row or you can say each interval will have two elements so space complexity will be linear time complexity will be n log n that is the problem merge overlapping intervals a very good problem a very important problem for interviews there will be a lot of follow-ups which you can actually solve there will be a similar kind of problems this strategy is a very common strategy which you can apply in a lot of problems like instead of intervals it can be named as meetings instead of intervals it can be named as the train at a particular platform what will be the arrival time what will be the departure time and so on so there can be different stories formed so you can go through all those problems until then bye bye take care."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem named find single number. You are given a non-empty array of integers non-empty array means array having at least one element that is size is at least greater than equal to one where every element appears twice except for one element that is in the entire array every element is occurring two number of times the frequency of each element is two except for one element and for one except element that is a single element that occurrence will be only one we can assume it because the question number is find single number. Your task is to implement a program that takes the input as an array of integers and returns the element that appears only once. So all the elements appears twice except the single element which occurs only once that is frequency. is only one and we have to find that single occurrence only. So input format will be of course the number of elements first of all that is the array size and then all the array elements which will be in the range from minus 3 times 10 raised to power 4 till plus 3 times 10 raised to power 4 that is almost integers both in negative and positive will be there and a very important note which is mentioned here is you should use a hash map based solution to efficiently identify the element that appears only once in the array there will be solutions which are better than hash map but for now we will be discussing them as a part of follow-up we will not code them because for them we require some extra knowledge which we will be learning after hash map which is actually based on some mathematics but even before discussing actually the hash map based solution we will start with a very brute force approach so what is the example let's take a bigger example this is a very basic one where there are only three elements elements in which 2 is repeating 2 times, 1 is not repeating, so 1 is the answer. How about this particular array, 2 repeating 2 times, 3 repeating 2 times, 1 not repeating, 4 repeating 2 times, so 1 is the answer. But it is not necessary that all the repeated elements, the repetition will occur at consecutive indices. In these two examples, you might think that the repeated elements will just come at i and i plus 1 index, but it is not true because nothing is mentioned in the problem description, so we can't assume anything and also we can't assume that all of the elements will be in increasing order or ascending order anything. They will be in any random order like the way it is in the second example 2314. So let's take a another test case which we are saying is nothing but having values 20, then let's say 40, then let's say 50, let's say 40, let's say 20, let's say maybe the element is 60 and let's say the element is you can say 50. So this is the array which is given to you and you need to find the element which only occurs once except that all the other elements except that answer will occur twice. So as you can see, 20 is occurring twice. So 20 is not the answer, 40 is occurring twice, 40 is not the answer. Even for that matter, 50 is occurring twice. So 50 is not the answer. Let's say the answer is not 60, but it is 30 just to let you know that it might not be the maximum. So I'm taking 30. So you can say 30 will be the answer because it is only occurring once. But the point is, how will you find this answer? Let me just undo all of this. A very brute force approach where you are not taking any data structure, you are not basically doing any kind of optimizations will be just to find which element is not repeating. That is, first you will ask 20, is the 20 occurring again in the remaining array? If it is occurring again in the remaining array, then it is not the answer. So I will run a loop over the remaining elements that is after the current index. If let's say the outer loop variable is I, I will run an inner loop variable, which is day starting from I plus one going until the last index and check if any other element is equals to I or not. So right now there is no more element which is equals to 20 and even for that matter you should not actually run for I plus one because otherwise what will you get is let's say if you are standing on this particular ith index, then you will say that is there any other I after is there any index after this ith index which is fourth index which is having value 20 and you will say no there is no index so you will return 20. So instead of just running the inner loop after the current index, what you can do is better to run a loop which is inner loop also over the entire array. That is you will run the jth loop also over the entire array just skipping the same index you should not just compare array of I with array of J when both I and J are zeroth index only. So you will start it from zero and you will check is there any more index having value 20 and you are saying that yes there is a pair which is 20. Now, let's try for the next index, maybe the next index is the answer, the element present at the next index. So I will say the ith index will get incremented. But now again, jth pointer will start from 0th index because the repeated element can be previous to it can be after it. So is this 40? No. Is this 40? Yes, but do not consider the same index. So skip it. Is this 40? No. Is this 40? Yes. So 40 is also repeating. It is not the answer. Then try for 50. So what do you will do for 50? Try the outer variable, the outer loop. And after making it incremented, you will start day again from the 0th index, except the third, the second index where I is currently at. You will check. Is there any other index also having the element? So what is the time complexity which is going to take for this kind of nested loop approach? We are saying outer loop is also going to work for the odd and elements in worst case. It might happen that the single element occurs. at the last index and the inner loop is also going to work for n times that is the entire array so it is n into n or you can say n square that is quadratic time however if we don't want a extra space then this is a good solution why because it is using constant extra space no extra data sector as such we are just maintaining two pointers i and j and that's it but the point is can we do better answer is yes since there is no ordering right now among the elements how about if we order all the elements maybe in ascending order or you can say increasing order we can easily ascend all the elements we can make them sorted in increasing order by using some inbuilt sort functions maybe it might use merge sort quick sort we don't know which sorting it will take internally but given that it will sort all the elements in n log n time which is the best possible time complexity for most of the sorting algorithms which are there as inbuilt sorting what you will do is you will just rearrange all these elements as first 20 next also 20 then it will be 30 then it will be 40 40 then it will be 50 50 let's say the element 30 was not the answer let's say 40 was the answer so what will you say is all the repeated elements will be occurring consecutively all the repeated elements will be occurring consecutively so what you can do is you can just check whether the element is same at the previous index and the next index if it is not present at the previous index as well as the next index then it is the answer like the way 20 are you single occurrence no 20 is also present at next index 20 are you single occurrence no it is a present at the previous index or what you can do is you can also just go to even indices if you want so as to that T are you a single occurrence yeah no because it is present at next index also and in this way you will be able to find the answer for 40 because when you will ask for T it is not present at next index but what will happen If let's say we are doing sorting, it will take n log n time, but we will be able to do it still in constant space, provided that the sorting used is an in-place sorting. That is, it does not take extra space, but still there is a scope of improvement and the scope of improvement when we say is by using the trade-off that if we still want to reduce the time complexity, we can actually use some extra space. And how will we actually use some extra space? That we are going to do using a key value pair data structure. That is what we need to store. We need to store for every element. How many times it is occurring? The element corresponding to the element, the frequency of it, that is key and value a pair of it. And we want all the keys to be unique. Basically we don't want two times 20 should occur. We want such a data sector where 20 should occur only once. And it should tell me the frequency of it. 40 corresponding to the frequency, 50 having some frequency. And once that entire data sector, that key value pair data sector is built, what we will do is we will find such elements, such key whose value, whose frequency, whose number of occurrences are only one. And that data sector is nothing but a hash map, or you can say it is nothing but a map in general. So what we will do is instead of maintaining two pointers, instead of sorting, just create an extra data sector where both key and value will be integers because both are elements and frequency of that element. While it will be empty, the hash map will be completely empty, zero size. You will start iterating over the array because that is how you will fill the hash map with the frequency of elements. 20 right now is having zero frequency. So put the new frequency as old frequency plus one, that is zero plus one. Because if it is occurring for the first time, you will take the old frequency as zero and put the new frequency or insert the new frequency as one. Similarly, for 40, since it is not there right now, you will put the new frequency as zero plus one. 50, since it is getting in. it for the first time 0 plus 1 but now 40 since it is getting inserted for the second time get the old frequency from hash map itself no need to go anywhere no need to again run a nested loop just check the hash map since 40 is already present get the frequency of it in hash map you can get a frequency or you can put a key value pair in constant time average case so you will get it in constant time in average case the frequency is 1 and you will update it with 2 that is put again the same key because whenever we put a key again in a hash map it does not insert two keys with same values but it will do what it will just update the value of the same key itself that is same pair itself there will be no two pairs having same keys it is a very important property of hash map you should learn it that all the keys in a hash map are always unique so that's why in the same key of 40 it will just update the frequency as 2 then going to 20 what it will happen we will say update the frequency as 1 plus one take the old frequency add one in it for 30 take the old frequency since it is not present we should take the old frequency as zero and put the new frequency as zero plus one and finally for 50 he will say old frequency is one take the new frequency as one plus one now you can run a for each loop over the elements in the hash map no need to run the loop again on array if you want you can run it but better will be to run a loop over hash map only because it will have less number of elements almost half number of elements why because the elements which are repeated in the first array or the input array they will not be repeated in the hash map so is a 20 is it a single occurrence no it is having two occurrence it is not the answer is 40 the answer no it is having two occurrences is 50 the answer no it is having two occurrences is 30 the answer yes it is only having single occurrence so using the hash map or using the key value pair data structure we will be able to do it in even lesser time and what will be the time complexity associated with it we will say Since we are first running a loop over the array of n size and inserting all the key value pairs in the hash map, insertion will be constant, but running a loop over the array will be linear in nature of order of n where n is the size of the array. And then running a loop over the hash map also will be order of n by 2 in worst case, which is still n only. So n plus n by 2, it is still linear. But since we are using a hash map, since it is about to store almost half of the size of the array, so space complexity is used, extra data structure is used, auxiliary data structure, which is a hash map of linear size. So linear time, linear space complexity, that is, there is a tradeoff which we are right now choosing time over space. We are optimizing time from n log n to n by using some extra space by compromising with space that is taking linear space. So what we will do is we will write the instruction manual for the hash map based solution only. We will be discussing this only. But just as a follow up, I am discussing one more approach. given that you know about bit manipulation, given that you know at least about the XOR operation. So there is a fourth solution also existing for this problem, which is even better than the HashMap based solution. And what is that? If you know a property of XOR that A XOR A will always give you zero. That is, if you will XOR something with itself, it will always give you zero value. And there is one more property. If you will XOR zero with something, it will give you that same thing. That is zero XOR A will always give you A. Given these two properties, you will be able to also answer this problem using XOR. That is, initialize a XOR value with a zero, start a XOR value with zero and take XOR of all the array elements in this XOR variable. That is, first take XOR of zero with a 20. So XOR is usually represented like this. Right now, I'm discussing a follow-up based solution, which you can try to explore on your own. But right now, I'm just discussing the approach. Then go to 40, take the the Zor in the answer that is the Zor variable. So right now 20 will not get canceled with 40 because A will get cancelled with A. Basically this you can represent that as A cancelling with A giving you zero. Like the way A minus A will give you zero. 50 you will take the Zor with it. Then now as soon as the next 40 comes, 40 Zored with 40 will get cancelled. You can assume it is getting cancelled with each other. Then 20 if you will take a Zor now is the point that this 20 will get cancelled with this 20. Now if you will take the Zor with 30 and finally if you will take the Zor with 50, 50 will get cancelled with 50. Basically what is Zor? Zor is nothing but if there are different bits, take the answer as 1. If there are same bits, take the answer as 0. That's why 40 and 40 will have same bits. So take the answer as 0 if you do the Zor between them. 20 Zored with 20 will give you the 0 bits. Similarly 50 with 50. So the only answer which will remain will be 0 XOR 30 or you can say simply 30 because anything XORed with any 0 is always that same thing. So answer will be 30 and that is nothing but the unique number that is not getting cancelled. Why? Because it is not repeating. All the numbers which are repeating will get cancelled. So using this wonderful property of XOR in how much time will you be able to do it? Since XOR operations are constant operations, we are still running just a single loop over the array. So time complexity will still be linear as same as the HashMap based solution. However, this time you are just creating a variable which is an integer variable, 4 bytes variable usually. So space now is constant. You are not creating any HashMap data structure as such, just a single variable which is going to give you the answer itself. So constant space, linear time, which is even better than the previous one. However, we will not write the code, but the code if you want to write for this problem or this solution will be only 3 to 4 lines. But still, since the problem itself is asking us to do it using HashMap. We will write the instruction manual for the third solution for the linear time linear space solution. So what we have to do first of all create a hash map create a hash map of what of keys as integers because it will be storing the elements and values also as integers and values as integers. Initially it will be empty. What we will do is run a for each loop for loop that is up to you how you want to run a loop over the array since we don't need the indices in the array we only need the values in the array. I am running a for each loop run a for each loop over the array elements and what we have to do put the elements with updated frequency but in order to do it first get the old frequency get the old frequency of element from hash map and you have to assume the note is assume frequency as zero the old frequency that is the frequency before updating. as 0 if element does not exist in HashMap, if element is not present in HashMap. So there might be some internal inbuilt function for your purpose when let's say you want to take the default frequency as 0 or even if let's say you are just simply picking up the frequency it might give you 0. Let's say if I talk about C++ if you will just get the frequency of any key which is not present in the HashMap. It will by default give you 0 only but in let's say Java you might have to use a function named as get or default to get the frequency 0 in the case of the key not existing. Otherwise it will give you null value if you will just simply use get function in that. So that's why I have given the node that assume frequency to be 0 not null or not undefined if the key is not present. Once you get the old frequency now put the pair as the same element that is key will be element and what value that is frequency. as the old frequency plus one because new frequency will be old plus one that is what we were doing getting the old frequency incrementing one in it and put it back and now the pair as e will be put back will be put back in the hash map now once we are done with the first loop now what we have to do is run another loop this time you can run a loop over array over hash map it is your choice i am running a loop over hash map run a for each loop over particularly keys of hash map and what we need to do is check if the value that is a frequency of that key of the key is one or not because if it is one then that is the answer that key is the answer if it is then return the key otherwise if there is no answer present however it will never happen that there is no answer because in the question it is clearly mentioned that it will always happen that every element will be occurring twice except one element but still still, if it is having such a scenario, when there is no single element, what you can do is you can assume you're returning one or zero or minus one, anything, but let's just return zero because in some languages, if you are not returning anything in the last, even if the function is returning or expecting you to return something, it will give you a missing return statement. Or you can say the function was not returning anything, error, some kind of error will be there. And in order to get rid of that, we are just returning zero in the last. So that we don't get any error. So this is a pseudocode for the problem, find a single number in Java programming language. So in order to use a hash map, we have to have to create a hash map, obviously, of what of he has integer and value as integer, that is a pair of integer comma integer. He will be the element value will be the frequency of that element in the array. Let's say hash map name is HM. However, you can name it anything as you want and better be to given meaningful names. Let's say frequency. req can be a better name because it is going to give you the frequencies of elements now since you only need the elements that is the values of the array not the indices you need 20 40 50 and so on you don't need 0 and 2 what I am doing is I am running a for each loop and how to run a for each loop in java that is take the type of element it is a integer in array to define integer name the variable as anything let's say element because it is going to give you the values of the array pollen in which array are you running the for each loop that is in which array are you always going to get the values from not the indices but the values so it is int element colon error that is the array name and what we have to do is we have to just first get the old frequency and in java how to get the old frequency one function is using get just get the element from hash map hm dot get element but get will give you the answer if the key is present it will you the frequency if there is the hash map exists or you can say the key exists in the hash map but if the key doesn't exist in the hash map then the get function will give you null because it does not check whether the key is present or not it will just simply give you null value so in order to get a default value if the element does not exist we have to get a zero value for that hash map also provides you another function which is get or default and how do you use it you will say old frequency is nothing but hash map get function but with a default value if the key doesn't exist if the element exists that is the key exists get me the value of that key get me the frequency however if we are inserting it for the first time the old frequency can be assumed zero so that we can do zero plus one for the very first time very first time the frequency will be put as one only now what i can do is i can put the new frequency as what the element with the old frequency plus one you can do it in the same single line also but that line will become very heavy very bloated. That's why I have break done in two different lines. Now that you are done with the first loop, you know each element how many times it is occurring. It is present in the hash map. That's why you will run a for each loop over hash map and you only need the for each loop over keys. So one by one I will get keys which is of integer type. You want to write integer. You can write it like this wrapper class or you want to simply write int also it will work both things will work. It will automatically get converted but since we are only going to run a loop over keys, I will store all the keys in a set that is a key set function can be used to get all the keys of the hash map and we are running a for each loop overall that set of keys that is one by one. I will be running a loop in the example over 20 40 50 30 in some order obviously keys. We can't guarantee the order of keys in a hash map. They can be in any random order. So get the keys from the hash map check what? is the frequency of them and now happily we can use get function because now we are sure the key exists in the hashmap because we are running the loop over hashmap only so no need to use get or default now you can simply use get function so in the hashmap if the key is having value one that is the frequency is one it is only occurring for one time and that element is the answer so return the key itself however if there is no such element you should have to return something otherwise your java will give you a missing return statement error so that's why i'm just returning zero just for the fact that you get rid of the compilation error if i will run this code hopefully it should run let's see the code is not big but it is a very important problem in terms of understanding the map based solutions so there is certain symbol which is hashmap which we are not able to get because we have wrote hashmap with hsmall it is not hsmall but h and m should be capital in hashmap map. In the left hand side, you can only write map on the right hand side, you should have to write or you must have to write hash map only. So it is working fine for sample test case. I am not discussing various corner scenarios. I'm just taking one bigger test case having values let's say 40, 50, 60, then let's say 30, 30, 60. And let's say 40 is unique or maybe not 40. Let's take the 60 to be unique and 40 should be repeated 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So there are seven elements in total. Let's just see. Hopefully it should give me the answer as the 60 element. I guess 60 was not repeating. Let's see. It was either 60 or 50. I'm not sure. Yes, it was 60 only. So it will work for all kinds of test cases. Hopefully let's just submit and wait for the current code. It is a previous submission which is being displayed right now, but the current submission is also working for all the corner cases. So even if there is only two elements or actually only one element in the array, not two elements, but only one element, that will be the answer. Our code is still going to work for that. You can do a try run. And even if there are a lot of elements, the maximum number of elements, according to the constraint, it will still work and the code will still work for negative elements. So I think we should wrap this problem with this video. At this moment, we will come up with a new video with a new problem. Till then, bye bye, take care."

So keep on upskilling yourself if you want to remain competitive in the IT field. Hi, this is Saurabh Shukla. I have done my BTech in Information Technology. I joined Cryo in the FDT department. While working in Cryo, the knowledge to expand further and deep dive into things and learn concepts, but after going through the forces of Cryo, I realized that I had missing, like some foundational knowledge was not really good. So the Cryo really helped me cover all those gaps and helped me move further in my career. So it helps conceptualize things in a really better way. And nowadays, if you go in any interviews and all, they are not really looking for people with advanced knowledge. They are looking for people who have strong foundational knowledge. All of these things can be built over time. The company will provide the specific training and technology. technologies they are working on, but the foundational knowledge, that is very essential. Cryo module is designed like in a very nice, when he goes from the initial to the final sprint, he covers all the bases, deepens his foundational knowledge. That is why like the Cryo course makes a person really competitive in the market. Aside from technical skills, like teamwork is also a quality and communication skills that are very essential for you to like succeed. Before coming to Cryo, I was more of a like individual contributor. Individual contributor is also nice, but you need to learn how to like work in a team and collaborate with others.

It is like really fills my heart with gratitude to all the people who like go through all this trouble to like help me. Even though the situation may seem hopeless, you should try your best because you may not know, you may think that nothing is going to come out of this, but that is not true. Sometimes miracles happen, but you may not get the expected output, but you should have faith in yourself and you should see all the things to the end. You should not leave things in the middle. If you have started something, you should finish that thing. Even if you fail, you should see the failure instead of leaving it in the middle. Otherwise, you may miss the opportunity that you may have."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem named union of two arrays. You are given two arrays A and B of different sizes as you can see the sizes can be n and m it means they can be of same size they can be of different size it is not necessary that both of the arrays will be same. You need to find the resultant array of the union between these two arrays so just a disclaimer that some of you might have already solved a problem named as merging of two sorted arrays if you have solved that problem this problem will feel similar to that but actually problem is different once we will complete the problem statement you will actually come to know that it is not same as the merging of two sorted arrays. So what you are given is two arrays input arrays are not sorted it is nowhere written it is sorted. sorted. So this is the first difference actually and output is the union not the merging. Merging is different. Union is different of the two arrays and form a single array out of the merged or you can say the union of both. Elements are not necessarily distinct in the input. In the input elements can be repeating. However, the note is union of two arrays. What do you mean by that? It can be defined as a set. Set means containing distinct elements, unique elements. Output should contain unique elements irrespective of whether input was containing unique or not. Input can contain duplicates, but output the union sorted array or not the sorted one, but the single array right now should be having distinct elements. But if there are repeated repetitions in the input, then only one occurrence of element should be printed in the union. That is again distinct element should be there. You should not take multiple occurrences in the output. But one more important point is resultant array that is the union. array should be in sorted order. This is the second requirement. So input format will be obviously the sizes of both the arrays and then both the arrays all the values space separated. So let's say the two arrays are of sizes five and three respectively. The first area as you can see is having values one, two, three, four, five. Second area is having values one, two, three. So it is fairly easy to find out the union that is all the elements set and it should not have repeated elements. So what do you say? All the elements will be one, two, three, five, only one, two, three, four, five. That is one, two, three is common among them. So it will only come once in the output because we need the unique elements and four or five, although it is only in the first area, still we want it in the output. And also what we are saying is the output should be sorted. That is output is having one, two, three, four, five. Although you might think that it is exactly same or just a little bit difference to merging, but the answer is no, because what can happen is the input arrays can be. sorted. So for that, if you see the second test case where the first areas of three size, the second areas of four size, first area is having values 58 and seven second areas having values 1785. You can see clearly it is not having a sorted fashion or increasing order after you will do union of both these areas. How will the union look like? You will say one will come in the union. Then next minimum will be five. Next minimum will be seven. Next minimum will be eight and all the other elements are actually repeating. So output should be 1578 with the unique elements only and in sorted order also. So maybe let's do what? Let's take some more test cases. So let's say the first area is having values 30. Then let's say 50. Then let's say 40. Then let's say 30 again. Then let's say maybe 20. Then let's say 40. Then let's say 60. And the second area, this is, let's say area one, which is having how many elements right now? 1 2 3 4 5 6 I am taking such array so that all the test cases will get covered in one example itself all the scenarios will get covered in one test case itself so the second array which I am taking is of different size but values let's say are 40 then let's say the next value is 40 again next value is again 40 next value you will say is let's say 10 next value is let's say maybe 60 next value is let's say how much maybe let's say 70 and next value is let's say 50 so these are the values or maybe let's not do 50 here let's do 50 here so that both the arrays are of different sizes so as you can see the first array is having n1 let's say as a 7 size second array n2 rather instead of taking n and m I am using n1 n2 as a size variables and the second array as you can see is of 6 size first of all what should be the output output should contain union that is all all the elements present from first array as well as second array but every element should occur only once it means out of all these elements the minimum element will be 10 next minimum will be 20 next minimum will be 30 next minimum will be 40 next minimum will be 50 and the final minimum will be the element which is 60 so all these elements will come but in increasing order and only once this is the output but the point is how to find this output one very brute force approach which might come to your mind is just apply a nested loop that is one loop will work on the first array another loop will work on the secondary I will run outer loop on the first array check whether it is present in the second array as well or not so I will check whether 30 is also present in the second array and in order to check it we have to run a loop so since 30 is not present in the secondary what we will do is we will just put 13 the output so initially 30 will get added in the output then check 50 is it present in the secondary no actually yes so what we will do is in order to ensure that 50 does not get inserted again what we can do is we can mark it minus one or we can mark it something which we should not insert some visited is what we can mark or maybe for now we can just not mark this particular value anything maybe we can just simply add 50 but when we are about to add it for the second time then we will check whether it is already added or not that is now I will check whether 40 should be added or not is 40 present in the output this time if you want to check if it is already inserted then you have to check for the output so since 40 is not present in the output insert it check for that day is it already present in the output yes it is already present in the output don't insert it again so you are running a loop in the output instead of running the loop on the secondary then you are running for 20 is it present no so insert it running the loop for 40 is it present yes don't insert it again running for 60 is it present already no so insert it Similarly, do it for the second array, so it will be the outer loop on both the arrays one by one and inner loop will be on the output array. But still, since there are two loops required, overall time complexity will be quadratic where the outer loop will be n1 plus n2 and inner loop will also become n1 plus n2 because output size can also be the summation of both. If all the elements are distinct, or you can simply say the time complexity will be quadratic in nature because you are just simply saying nested loops is what we are doing. Can we do better than nested loops? The answer is yes, there are at least two approaches. Since right now the output order which is expected is a sorted order, both of those approaches which I am about to discuss will be taking same time complexity. But if let's say there is a problem which does not require you to print the output in sorted order, then the two approaches out of those, one approach will be a better approach and one will be better. a poor than the other one or you can say worse than the other one. That is, both of them are at least better than the nested loop, but one of them will be even better than the other one. If and only if the output is what is expected in any random order that is not in sorted order. But right now let's discuss the first approach, which is using sorting plus two pointer using similar to what you have might have done in the merging two sorted arrays. So what I will do is since we are not sure whether the input arrays are already sorted or not, first thing what we can do is just sort both of them. So after sorting the first area, how will it look like? You will say minimum value is nothing but 20. It will come here. Then 30 will come here. Then one more 30 is there. Then 40 are present two times again. Then there is a value which is 50 and finally there is a value 60. What about secondary? After sorting the secondary, it will have 10 and it will have 43 times. Then it will have 50 and 60. Some of you want to form a single union array, one pointer you will require on the first array, another pointer on the second array, zero zero index, because output is also what is required to be sorted. So now, since both the areas are sorted, you can just compare whether to take 20 or whether to take 10. So since 10 is smaller, take 10 increment this pointer, whether to take 20 or whether to take 40, 20 should be taken increment the pointer, which is pointing on 20 because 20 is taken. Whether to take 30 or 40, 30 should be taken smaller value. We want increasing order output, but now see very carefully again, 30 is coming. Should we take duplicates in the output? The answer is no, we should not say that again, insert 30, because 30 is smaller than 40. So before insertion one check, which you have to make extra apart from what you usually do in merging two sorted arrays is that before insertion check, whether that element is already present at the last index. If there are duplicates, they will come at adjacent indices in doubt. output because output is also sorted so just check with the previous index if previous index exist and it is having the same value don't insert the node that is don't insert 30 again simply skip it now 40 versus 40 you can actually do what you can insert 41 time and just increment both the pointers why because again 40 will not get inserted duplicate times again there is a 40 versus 40 so again you can say don't insert both of them this time because this 40 is same as this one this 40 is also same as the last index so just increment both the pointers or you can increment one one pointer at a time now 40 versus 50 again 140 is the minimum the second array is 40 which is still the same value don't insert duplicates simply discard it now is that point you will compare 50 with 50 insert 50 increment both the pointers 60 versus 60 insert 60 increment both the pointers as soon as the first array finishes you can just simply run a loop on the second array and do the same job or if The second array gets finished you can run the loop on the first array and do the same job. So what will be the time complexity associated with it? You might say it is n1 plus n2 but no you are wrong because when it comes to merging two sorted arrays we do order of n1 plus n2 time given that the two arrays in the input are already sorted but in this question the two arrays were not sorted. We first sorted both the arrays and then applied two pointers. So sorting both the arrays will require n1 log n1 plus n2 log n2 time and then to merge both of these arrays into a single array by discarding duplicates it will take n1 plus n2 time because output can be worst case having all the elements present in first array plus second array that is n1 plus n2 in worst scenario. So since we are just applying two pointers one pointer running n1 times second pointer running n2 times that's why it is n1 plus n2 only. So overall time complexity you can say will go in worst case as n log n. where n you can represent as N which is the overall size of the output due to the fact that we need output to be sorted but there is a even better algorithm which will work obviously for this particular scenario where we have to give the output in sorted order but which it will work even better if we don't want the output to be sorted. So what is that third approach that third approach is focusing on the part that we want unique values and what is such a data sector which can give us unique values such a data sector is known as set data sector we actually don't require map here because we don't want to store value for a key that is we won't store how many times a particular element is there we don't care whether 40 is present three times or four times or five times we don't care we only need to check whether an element is already part of the output or not so what we will do is we will say that given the first array given the second second array. Run a loop on the first array, insert all the elements in the set. Then run a loop on the second array and insert all the elements in the same set and set will maintain uniqueness over the values. So I will run a loop. Insert 30 since 30 is not present. It will get inserted for the first time. Since 50 is not presented, it will get inserted for the first time. Since 40 is not present, it will get inserted for the first time. 30 is not present. Actually, 30 is present, but don't insert it automatically set will ignore the insertion. It will just skip the insertion because the element is already there in a set data structure, a hash set. You will not have duplicate keys. That is a property of set. Then 20 will get inserted because 20 is not inserted yet. Then 40 will get inserted. No, because it is already there. 60. Yes, it will get inserted because it is not there till now. 40 will not get inserted because it is already there, already there, already there. What about 10? It is not there. Get inserted. 60 is already there. of whether it was inserted by the first array or by the second array we don't care it is there in the set don't insert it again 50 is already there don't insert it again so as you can see the set data sector will have all the unique values however since in this current question what we require is a sorted output now there are two things which you can do either first put all these set values into a list or into an array whatever is the output expected return type and then just sort that array and return it that is sort that list after converting the set into a list and return the sorted list or what you can do is instead of making a hash set instead of making a set which is unordered hash that are usually unordered that is they can have keys in any order it is not necessary it will have the keys in the sorted order what you can do is you can go with a sorted hash set actually it is not known as a hash set in that case it will be a sorted set or you can say In some languages, it is known as a tree set because internally it is using a binary search tree, a variation of it, or you can say a self-balancing binary search tree. So the point is either if you don't know about such a set, if it does not exist in your language, maybe reset or order set does not exist. Just go with the normal set to list conversion and then sort that list. Or you can actually go ahead with that direct sorted set itself, and then just convert that sorted set into a list. Now, no need to sort it again because it is already sorted. In both of these scenarios, considering the output, that is the set size to be N, capital N, which can be worst case N1 plus N2, converting a set into a list will take N time only, but then sorting that list will take N log N versus if you are creating a sorted set itself, inserting elements in a sorted set will take log N time where N is the size of the set and inserting N such elements in that sorted set. will take n log n time and then if you are just putting all those elements from sorted set into a list it will take n time so irrespective of whether you do this it is n plus log n or whether you do this it is n log n plus n the overall time complexity will remain same as the previous approach which is n log n only so the point is this algorithm will have or this approach will have the same time complexity due to the fact that we want output to be in sorted order if output was not expected to be in sorted order then we can just skip this final step that is just print all these elements in the order which hash that is given to us and since hash set will get insertions in constant time average case n insertions will be only n that is if the question was not expecting us the sorted order it will take only linear time not n log n time in that scenario approach 3 will be better than approach 2 but right now if you want to go with approach 2 it is still fine because it is still taking the same time what about space complexity if we are talking about the approach to or maybe let's start with the approach one directly that is the nested loop in this space complexity will be constant that is you will not require any extra data sector as such you just have to input arrays and one output array we never usually include input and output into extra space right now we are talking about extra space or auxiliary data sectors so for the first brute force solution it is constant extra space for the second sorting plus two pointer solution sometimes what happens is the sorting which you are doing if it is a merge sort or if it is a quick sort it might take n time or actually n space due to the recursion or due to maybe the merging requiring you to create a new array so sorting if it is going to take n space you can say space complexity will be linear that is order of n. And what about the third approach again since you are clearly seeing that we are making a set data structure or you can say a sorted set data structure which is extra which is auxiliary data structure not given in the input not given in the output so it will again take linear space only that is the space complexity will be order of n where n is capital n that is the sum of both the individual arrays n1 plus n2 in worst case output can also have all the elements so with that we are done with the three approaches however the instruction manual which i am going to write will be based on the third approach because right now we are practicing the problems based on set data structure so what we are going to do is we are going to say that create a sorted set and in the bracket i am writing that sorted set might be named as a tree set in your language like in java it is known as tree set in c++ it is only known as set if you just create a set variable it will be a sorted set not a unordered set so create a sorted sorted set of integers do what run a for each loop probably no need to run a index based loop you just have to get values of the arrays so run a for each loop over both arrays and insert them insert them into the set insert all the values in the set once we have inserted all the values what we have to do is copy the elements copy the elements from the sorted set into a list into a list so that we can return that list the final step will be just returning that list so it will be just four or five lines of code not that much provided that there is a inbuilt library which you can use to the use the sorted set if it is not then maybe you can just go with the hash set or maybe you can go with the sorting plus 2.0 so we will be writing the code in java programming language and how to create a sorted set in java it is free. with the T capital S capital the type should be of integers that is keys will be integers because input is of integer arrays or the lists so I will create a set of sorted in nature that is a binary search tree a self-balancing binary search tree initially it will be empty but how we will populate it is by running a loop for each loop probably on both the arrays on both the lists that is the list maybe so I will run a loop over the first array on the values by using this syntax that is I will get one one element at a time from the array since arrays of integers you can write int here it will work or if you just directly want to write integer it will still work again but the point is it will not give you the indices 0 1 2 3 up till n minus 1 it will rather give you the values directly that is if this is the array the element variable will not iterate over 0 1 2 internally it will iterate but element variable will be storing 50 40 30 and so on one by one you will be getting the values and you have to just insert them into the set that is set dot add will be the function to insert the element so you don't have to care whether the element is already there in the set or not add operation will automatically take care of the insertions not for duplicates that is duplicates even if you are trying to insert it will not get inserted because that is a property of set same thing you have to do for the secondary I am just running the loop and just replacing a with b that is a second list and inserting all the elements from secondary as well now that we have both the array of elements into the set they are first of all unique that is not duplicate because of the property second thing again because of the tree set property sorted set property all the values will be in increasing order by default and what you can just do is pop all the elements or run a loop over the set and insert them into the them in a list which you have to return I will create a list which will be initially empty and how to create a list on the left hand side because we want to return a list left hand side should be a list list is actually an interface in Java but to create an object of list to instantiate a list you can't do it like list is equal to new list this is not a correct syntax you can't create objects of interfaces you will have to create object of something implementing list so you can do maybe a link list you can do maybe a error list you can do vectors also but the easiest were the most famous ways using error list so you can implement the list using a list and initially it will be having zeros elements zero size list will be there what we will do is we will populate it with all the elements in the set so this time the third for each loop rather working on the first a list or the B list but instead of them it will now work on the set that is copy elements from the sorted set into the list that is I will say in the array the output array just insert at the last index that is add operation again the current element and as soon as we are done it we will just return that list so we will just say return this particular list that is the error you can name it anything so let's see if it is going to work fine or not let's wait for the sample output to be correct then only we will submit it as you can see it is working for this corner scenario where the input also was sorted but even if input is not sorted still it will work and as you can see input is having duplicate elements that is one is present in both the arrays still it is only coming one times in the output that too sorted it means the logic is working fine let's do what let's submit it and confirm whether it will work for all test cases or not right now it is showing a previous submission let's wait for the current submission to show up so it takes some time to show up the submission but it will get auto refresh as you can see Now it is getting accepted and what is the time complexity for this creating a tree set does not involve any time complexity but inserting the elements in that tree set will require log n for each insertion in average case or even in worst case and if we are doing n such insertions where capital n is nothing but n1 plus n2 that is the first array size plus second array size it will be n1 plus n2 times log n1 plus n2 or you can simply say capital n times log capital n n log n and then what you are just putting is running a loop over the set which you can do in linear time that is order of n time and put all the elements in a error list so that is a linear operation so n log n plus n overall time will be n log n we always take the biggest power of n or the biggest term what about space complexity since right now we are using a set data structure or extra data structure auxiliary data structure which can contain all the n elements n1 plus n2 space complexity will be linear so time is n log n space is n what you can do is you can try to solve some problems related to this maybe merging of two arrays intersection of two arrays problem might be in union of two arrays without the sorted part without output needs to be sorted for that you will actually have to do it with hash set if you want to do it with the most optimized way so having said that let's keep this video till this point we will meet in a new video with a new problem till then bye bye take care"

So I wanted to bridge that particular gap. From the last two years, I was working at Infosys as a systems engineer. As part of Cryo, right, I've seen the slogan, like learn by doing. So that fascinated me. And that is the main motto of me joining Cryo. A few of my friends told me about it. I wanted to give it a try. I've read a lot of success stories. Well, it turned out really a good decision. Earlier, I write a particular piece of code, but I don't know why we are writing that particular piece of code for that particular functionality. It's because it's present in the documentation. We're just copy pasting that. But, you know, now it's entirely different because I have had that confidence and I haven't had that level of, you know, understanding. We were taught how to structure our code and even documenting it so that other developers can easily understand our code. You know, be there. inculcated the habit of reading the documentations and finding out the answers by ourselves instead of spoon-feeding the answers. Mostly all these things really helped me in my interview as well, because these were the things, you know, interviewers are expecting us to know beforehand. If we are willing to work hard and if we are willing to, you know, put our effort and time, Cryo would definitely help us in achieving our goals."

        "transcription": "Now we will start our discussion around while loop. What is while loop exactly? Okay, we have already seen the for loop. Let's try to understand what will be your value. A while loop is also a loop in Java. Now, why Java has given you two types of loop for loop was already there in my job has given you value. So why loop is mostly used in the scenarios where you don't know the termination condition. So in case of for loop, we used to write int i is equal to 0, i is less than 10 something like that. Then i plus plus. So the termination condition was quite clear to us, right? But while loop are usually mostly used in the scenarios where termination condition is not that clear. One example would be just create an infinite while loop. While loop. true. That means you don't know the termination condition based on certain scenarios you will terminate your program. It is an infinite loop. So in case of infinite loops right you should go with a while loop. Okay now let's try to understand the syntax of while loop how while loop is exactly written. So for that we will recall our discussion around for loop. In for loop what was the first part? Yes the first part was initialization. Second part was your condition and third part was your increment decrement. Same holds true for your while loop also. So how many times we did we perform initialization? Once. So that is why initialization will be done outside the loop in case of while loop. Now we have a condition. Condition and increment decrement will be done till the time loop holds true. So that is why in case of while loop with the keyword while you will write your condition. This will be your condition. Now define the scope of a while loop with the help of curly bracket inside this curly bracket. You will have your statement to be executed. Statement and then after that your increment decrement operation that is I plus plus in this particular scenario. We will consider an increment decrement to be I plus plus. So this is how you will define your while loop. Now, let's convert this while loop to a normal code. This was just the syntax. Let's convert it to a normal program. Okay, we will have our increment. Then let's have a while loop while condition i is less than let's say 4 till the time i is less than 4. We will print the value of I so let's have a print statement. Println i then i++. Ok, now we will try to understand the same logic with the help of a flowchart. Ok, so I'll just write down the code what exactly we have understood. i is equal to 0 initial value then after that we have our condition as i less than 4 then print. This is your condition. Print then i++. Yes, this is how our program is right. Let's convert this to flowchart and we will try to do the dry run around that. Okay. So first part is your increment. Increment task. Post increment is done. We will have our loop loop will begin. So first of all, you will check for the condition. Now either the condition can hold true or it will become false. So this is scenario when it become false and here it will go when it becomes true. In case it is true. We will have a print. And post the print. We will have increment. Once you have incremented the value, it will loop back to your condition. Ok, so let's do a dry run on this flowchart. Ok, so first of all, you will do the increment how many times increment and initialization will be done only once you will initialize the value. Now you will check the condition i is equal to 0. Is 0 less than 4? Yes, that holds true. So we will enter inside our loop, print the value and increment the value of i. i will be printed as 0, incremented value of i will become 1. Again in the loop, check the condition. Is 1 less than 4? That is also true. Print the value of i that is 1 and increment it. Incremented value of i will be 2 now. Go back to loop, check the value. Is 2 less than 4? That is also correct. print the value as 2, increment the value to 3. Again check the condition. Is 3 less than 4? That is also correct. Print the value of 3, increment the value of 4. Is 4 less than 4? Is that correct? No, 4 cannot be less than 4 so it is false now. Since it is false we will come out of the loop. This is your outside the loop statement. So this is how you will do the while loop and how while loop works. Let's write some basic program related to while loop. For that we will use the concept or the program related to little prince. Let me explain what this little prince problem statement is. So there is a prince and this prince wants you to print the star symbols. So the first part is prince will give you stars count. Let's say he has given you count as 10. So basically your task is to print 10 star symbols. This is your task. Now the second task what Prince has given you he will give you a number and whatever be the number and you have to print alphabets or sorry in numbers from that number. Let's say he has given you n is equal to 10. So basically you have to print all the numbers starting from 1 2 3 4 till 10 if n is equal to 10. Over here also if number of stars is equal to 10 you have to basically print 10 star symbol. 10 stars. This is your task. So let's start with the first part. Let's start with the first program. So we will start with our normal. First of all, let's create a variable in I is equal to one. Why? I is less than equal to number of stars. We will print. System dot out dot println a star symbol and then increment the value of I I plus plus We will take our same example of 10 and try to run this program. So we are able to print 10 star symbol. Yes, let's solve the second problem. Now in the second one. Also, we will start from I is equal to 1. We will have a while loop while I is less than equal to n. System.out.println i and then i++. This problem statement is count to hide. So let's run this and validate. We are able to print the numbers from 1 to 10. So these two were some basic problems which we have solved with the help of while loop. Let's do a somewhat advanced problem now. So for that we will switch to cryo platform. Let me explain the problem statement to everyone. Okay. The problem statement is given the number given an integer n you have to find the nth Fibonacci number. So basically our task is to find the nth Fibonacci number. So before we start with the problem, right? Let me explain you guys what is Fibonacci number. Let's understand that. So Fibonacci number first 0th Fibonacci number is always 0. The first Fibonacci number is 1. Let me repeat myself. The 0th Fibonacci number is always 0. The first Fibonacci number is always 1. Now after that it will be sum of last two numbers. What is the sum of last two numbers? 0 plus 1 is 1. So your second Fibonacci number is 1. Again, what will be the next Fibonacci number? Sum of last two numbers. So 1 plus 1 which will become 2. What will be your next Fibonacci number? Sum of last two numbers. 1 plus 2. So it will become 3. The next Fibonacci number will be 2 plus 3. So that is equal to 5. Similarly, next one would be 8 and so on. So always 0th Fibonacci number will be 0. First Fibonacci number will be 1. After that it will be sum of last two numbers. Everyone clear with the Fibonacci number? numbers. Now your task is to find out nth Fibonacci number. So whatever is the n value given here, you have to find out nth Fibonacci number. Let's try to understand the solution with the help of whiteboard and then we will switch to coding. So we understood this part 0th Fibonacci number will be 0 then after that it will be first Fibonacci number will be 1 and then it will be sum of all the remaining numbers. So let's write the 0th and 1. 0th number will be always 0, 1st will be always 1. So if n is given as 0, you will return 0 directly. If n is given as 1, you will return 1. as 1 n is basically you have to find out nth Fibonacci number. So if someone will ask you to find 0th Fibonacci number, it will be always 0. If someone will ask you to find first Fibonacci number, it will be always 1. Yes, so 0th and 1 we all know that now. We will have a loop rate in a loop. We will always find out. Let's Let's create some variable. Num 0 that is your 0th Fibonacci number will be 0 num 1 That is your first Fibonacci number will be 1. We have stored it in a variable now. Now in a loop, we will try to find out the upcoming Fibonacci number. So let's move to the second position. So your loop in your loop from the second position onward. We will create a output variable. Output variable. So output will become in a loop. So from for the second position at at the second position your output will be some of your previous to yes, so it will become 0 plus 1. Which is equal to 1 also? You will need to replace your num0 and num1 right? It should always store the previous two numbers. Yes. So now your 0th number needs to point to 1. Yes, and your num1 needs to point to this particular one, right? That is nothing but your output. Yes, to find out the next number. It has to point to the previous two. Okay, let's go to the next index at next index in order to calculate your output. We will calculate num0 plus num1 that is 1 plus 1 which is equal to 2 now we got our output but now my num0 instead of this one it has to point to the new one. which is nothing but your number one and your number one will start pointing to your output which is equal to your two. Yes, you will have to basically just move your pointer right? These two should also be moved. It should always point to the previous two numbers. That's what we are trying to do here. So your num0 num0 has to be replaced with num1. And num1 will be replaced with output. Yes, so this is how we will replace the values every time. Okay, let's convert the same logic to the Java code. If n is equal to 0 we all understood this if n is equal to 0 that means we have to return 0th Fibonacci number. So what will be our output 0? Fibonacci number will be 0th Fibonacci number. Similarly, if n is equal to 1, we have to return 1. So these two are my edge cases. If n is equal to 0, it will be always 0. If n is equal to 1, it will be always 1. Now, let's initialize all the three variables int num0 is equal to 0 int num1 will be equal to 1 int output. Output here will be also equal to 0. Initially, we will consider output to be 0. Now, we got the 0th Fibonacci number, 1st Fibonacci number. So my loop will start from second index number. Let's consider the loop to be while loop. Let's create an index variable index will be starting from zip to Y. Index is less than equal to n. My output will be sum of previous two number that is num0 and num1. Now num0 will be traversed by one index so it will become num1. Num1 will also traverse by one index so it will become output. We will increment our index at the end. And at the end we will return our output. Let's do our dry run. Let's consider a sample case where your n is equal to 3. We will take the same case whatever is given over here n is equal to 3 is n equal to 0 is 3 equal to 0. Is that true? No is 3 equal to 1. No, so we will initialize our variable num0 is equal to 0 and num1 will be initialized with 1. Your output will be initialized with 0 and index will be initialized with 2. We will do a check now. Is 2 less than equal to 3? Is this correct? Yes, that is correct. So enter inside my loop. So my output will be num0 plus num1. So it will be basically 0 plus 1. What is the output now? 1. Now your num0 will be replaced with num1. So it will become 1. Even your num1 will be replaced with output. So my output is 1. So it will be replaced with 1. Increment the index. So index will become 3 now. We will again perform the check. Is 3 less than 3? Less than equal to 3? Yes, that is also correct. So your output will be num0 plus num1 some num0 plus num1 is basically 1 plus 1. Just see here. It is equal to 1 plus 1. So 1 plus 1 will become 2. Now your num0 will be initialized with num1. What is the value present in num1? It is 1 only. So it will be initialized with 1. Num1 will be replaced with output. What is the value present in output? 2. Increment the index. Index will be incremented to 4. Again perform this check. Is 4 less than equal to 3? Is that correct? No. Since the condition is false now, we will come outside the loop and return the output. So my output as of now is equal to 2. So 2 will be returned. Let's run our code and validate the output. Yes, so we are able to run it for all the test cases. This was the problem related to while loop. So we have seen multiple problems related to while loop. At least three or four problems. This wraps up our discussion around the while loop concept. Thank you."

In Cryo, I was getting the opportunity to work on the micro experiences. So I was undergoing into the full stack developer program.

A scope of learning definitely increases over there when you interact with a lot of different people. The support that we got from Cryo that was really helpful for me. I initially got stuck into a lot of issues. They made me learn those things on my own. That really helped me to understand my capabilities as well.

That definitely, somehow I have adopted that and it's helping me. It's going to be a lifelong learning for me. Before joining Cryo also, I tried updating my resume and put it into the organization's career portal. Somehow I used to get the rejection email.

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video, we will be discussing the problem find the longest substring with at most k distinct characters. So this problem will be a problem based on HashMap plus two-pointer technique. So if you don't know the basics of the HashMap data structure or the two-pointer technique first you should know the concept because that will be a prerequisite we are given a string we need to find the length of the longest substring that is a part of a string which is contiguous all the characters should be consecutive the length of such substring which is longest but the constraint is it should contain at most k distinct characters there should be no more than k different characters even if the characters are there the number of different characters you can say should be only k and there should also be only k obviously no repeating characters because it is saying that the kid distant characters should be there so we can assume that there will be no repeating characters or let's see actually in the example whether we have to include repeating or not. So the notice uppercase and lowercase characters should be considered as different characters that is capital a is different from small a we have to just keep this in mind and also there can be number special characters as well. That is there can be any sky code present in the spring. It can have underscore dollar hash anything. So what we are given is we are given two values n and k and will be the strings length a will be the value which we need to basically do for the validation. That is we have to find a substring with at most a distant character. So case also needs to be given in the input and also for the string will be given. So if I take the string having five length the string is a b a c d. and the K value is 3. So if I just write the string again, A B A C D K value is 3. What is the substring with at most 3 distinct characters? The answer they are saying is of 4 length that is having string A B A C. So actually as you can see in the example input, we have to include repeating characters also. If we can include repeating characters, no problem, we can include it. But whatever characters we are including the count of different characters, distinct characters should not be more than K. As you can see the answer which they are saying A B A C is of 4 length and it is only having 3 different characters A B C. If you want to include D, you have to include A also from here also. So in that case, the string will only become 2 length which is not the maximum length. So that's why the answer is 4. If I take the second example, which is having string capital X small y small y Z small y A and the number of characters distinct characters which we need is k is equal to 3. If I take capital X, if I take small y, then I can only take still 5 small y that is z also. So in this case, there will be three distinct characters, we can't take a and what will be the length, the length will be 5, that is not what the maximum length is. Or you can also take instead of capital X, you can also take small a, even though if it was not small a, even if it was small x, still it should be only 5 length y because capital X is different from small x, we have to treat them differently, that is what is given in the question also. So any route for the solution which we can just directly think of, most of you will also be able to think of is that how about generating all the substrings because we have to find the longest substring. Let's just first generate all the substrings and out of all the substrings, we will check whether they are following the constraint or not, whether the number of distinct characters are only k or at most. most K or not. If yes, update the maximum answer. If not, do not update the answer. So to generate all the substring it will require two nested loops or you can say one loop as outer loop for start pointer another loop as inner loop for the end pointer the starting and ending index for the substring where the substring is starting where the substring indexing and ending that will be n square but to count the number of unique characters it will have the third loop so overall it will be three loops and cube in nature although what you can do is you can try to optimize it and combine the third loop within the second loop only that is while you are running the loop for the right pointer while you are including characters you can just also count how many unique characters are there so that would require order of n square time complexity two loops will be there which are running for the entire string so without using any extra space we will be able to do this problem in n square time complexity but as you can see n is very large. and it's tennis for fight it might go into time limit exceeded if we are just going to follow the brute force we are not going to go into that we are going to optimize it further but when it comes to optimizing it further from n square what we have to do is we have to maybe run a single loop only either two solutions exist either n log n or n so let's try to actually think of a solution in linear time complexity now what do we need to do when we are just running a single loop while running the loop we have to maintain the count that what are the number of repeating characters what are the number of unique characters so for that let's just take a string let's just take this particular string and in this ring let's also take the value of K which is 3 we want only three distinct types of characters in our string or maybe let's take four distinct characters for that matter and we need to count the longest substring which is only having four different types of characters So while we are including characters what we need to also and basically maintain is how many unique characters are there in the current substring while we are including a there is only one unique character so good at most 4 should be there while including B at most 4 yes 3 is less than equal to 4 again 3 is less than equal to 4 again 4 is less than equal to 4 but as soon as I include E it is now more than 4 the number of unique characters are 1 2 3 4 5 so now we have to exclude the characters and in order to exclude the characters since we are including from the right side better will be to exclude from the left side why because obviously the pointer to include will keep on including the elements one by one but if I will exclude it from the same side we will go back to the previous step and we will just be stuck in an infinite loop that is again you will include one element then again you will say it is having more characters than 4 discarded again included discarded so in order to just keep moving this do not go into infinite loop let just start the element from the other side that is from the left side so we will discard a as soon as you discard a number of unique characters again come out to be four only at most four then you can include you can start again including f as soon as we include we have to again discard and if we are going to discard b the number of any characters one two three four five it will be still five so we have to discard all the characters of b that is we have to discard this c also because we need a substring we can't just discard this character and this character so we have to discard both of these characters then only we will say the number of unique characters will be less than equal to four so since we need a pointer to include characters let's say this is the right pointer which is used to include the characters and we also need a pointer to discard the characters let's say this is the left pointer so there will be a two pointer approach. Both of these pointers will be managing a window of substring. So it is going to be known as a sliding window technique and that too of a dynamic size. So it will be a dynamic sliding window approach. But to know what is the last occurrence of the current character or what is the last time a different character was found, we have to basically just keep on discarding the elements till we are getting the same element. See, if I am saying for F, when I am including F, I have to discard the elements till I am getting the count back to 4, the number of unique characters count back to 4. So I have to get the frequency of each character, that is, what is the last time the current character was occurring or how many times the current character was occurring in the current substring. And not just the current character, but every character in the substring, how many times are they occurring, so that we can know whether the substring is having less than or equal to 4 characters. are more than four characters and for that we are going to maintain one data sector which will just store the frequencies of each element and that data sector which will store the character with that frequency a key value pair will be a hash map so we will maintain a hash map in which searching is also very easier and also insertion is also easier hash map will have the character for which the frequency needs to be stored as the key value as a key actually and the value will be you can say the frequency that is a integer initially hash map will be empty initially we can say we have to include characters so in order to include characters let's start including from the zeroth index itself that is from the starting although we will have the excluding pointer the right pointer will be the including pointer left pointer will be for excluding left pointer will also start from zero because if we want to exclude later on we have to exclude from zeroth index itself and initially you can say the maximum length will be 0. How many characters are there in the current substring which are not repeating or actually even if they are repeating how many are unique we have to maintain the unique count also. So as you can see in the current substring which is actually empty there are zero unique characters. Till now we have not started. First we will include A. If I will include A, the A's frequency will become 1. It is occurring for the first time and also the number of unique characters will become 1 because it is the first character. Is it less than equal to 4? Yes. So answer will also become 1 length. Right minus left plus 1. 0 minus 0 plus 1. 1 length. Only A string. It is having less than equal to 4 unique characters. So we will try to include the next character. We will try to include each and every character one by one. If I will include B, can I include it? Yes. Because it will only have 2 unique characters or you can actually say the unique will be also getting from the size of the hashmap because the number of key value pairs in the hashmap. denotes the number of unique keys because hashtag will only contain unique keys so no need to maintain the unique variable also you can just get the size of the hashmap so since there are two keys two is less than equal to four it is good and what is the length length is 1 minus 0 plus 1 2 length the subtraction is of 2 length can we include C yes it is not occurring till now the hashmap length is 3 it means there are three characters different characters are there so good enough and answer will also become 3 can we include B again yes although the frequency of B will become 2 but still the hashmap size is 3 less than equal to 4 being time loaded length will become 4 can we include G also as soon as you include G the hashmap size becomes 4 equal to K still it is good because it should be at most K and now the length is 5 right minus left plus on 4 minus 0 plus 1 so still good enough now but as soon as I include the character E if I am going to include include e what will happen the number of unique characters will become 5 why because the number of key value pairs in the hashmap will become 5 so now we need to discard a character from left because we discussed we can't just discard from same right so first discard a character if I will discard a I will do frequency minus minus while including we were doing frequency plus plus while discarding we will do frequency minus minus and now since a is having zero frequency let's just delete it from the hashmap so that it is not just getting the size of hashmap as more than 4 so as soon as I delete a that is do right the left but actually plus plus because it is discarded now again the number of unique key value pairs are 4 only that is good although the length is only you can say 5 which is already the answer do not update the answer next character is f can we include it we have to include it always but after including it with one frequency again the hashmap will become five size now I have to make it again for that is at most for I have to make so again discard characters for this card be all the frequency will become one it is not completely discarded discard see the frequency of C will become 0 and as soon as I discard see the number of unique characters will become 4 1 2 3 4 so good what is the string length for only not greater than 5 in this fashion we have to include when I exclude let's just quickly do the dry run for the remaining string if we will include G the number of unique characters will again become 5 so again discard characters or discard B if I will discard B the frequency will become 0 so delete it again the number of unique characters will become 4 and we can say actually G was already present we don't have to do this G was already present with one frequency so don't discard B we can just have B on already because number of unique characters will still remain for only so what is the length length is 5 this card index will be the left pointer b and g e f these are only four characters but now when I will include a that is the point the number of unique characters will become 5 so do keep on doing this again and again till we are getting the maximum length so as you can see I am not going to do the complete dry run you can just take the string till this point we can say the maximum length will be in the answer in how much time are we able to get it we are just running a simple loop over the input string and as soon as the right pointer reaches the string dot length we can stop because we have included each and every character although the excluding character pointer is also going to run a loop it will be a nested loop but still time complexity will be linear why because both of these pointers will not run in a nested fashion it is not like when right is at 8 left is going from 0 to 7 when left is right is at 7 left is going from 0 to 6 and so on no when right is becoming plus plus left may or may not become plus plus but when left is becoming plus plus it will not go backwards if it is becoming plus plus it will just move forward only so both the pointers will move forward for n times inverse case and n plus n will be 2n overall time complexity will be linear but when it comes to space complexity we can say that we are using a hash map which is extra space or auxiliary data sector of order of 256 different types of p-value pairs inverse case because at most these many different characters can exist 256 characters in a sky code although if we include unicode or if we consider the array of integers instead of array of characters or the string we can say the space will also be linear it is just a matter of perspective that I have you seeing as it is a perspective of different characters since different characters can be at most 256 usually in a sky codes so you can say it is constant end or if you are taking it as a perspective of the array size or the string size, you will say it is linear space. So both are correct answers. You have to just explain it accordingly. Now, let's do what let's write the code according to the approach that you have discussed. Not the code, but actually the pseudocode that is an instruction manual. First of all, we have to create a hash map hash map of E as a character and value would be nothing but the integer of the occurrence is the number of occurrences. We will say just maintain two pointers, but second pointer that is the right pointer to include we can just have it in the loop itself because it will include every time but for right the left pointer will only exclude sometime. So let's make it outside the loop. So set a left pointer as you and also the maximum length we need to store. So answer we need to store so we can also set that as a zero. We will try to run. a for loop run a for loop over right index from zero till the string dot line minus one two strings last index that is n minus one string is of n characters whatever right character we are having just included by doing frequency plus plus include right character by doing frequency plus plus in hashed map but as soon as you included check what is the size of hash map check if size of hash map is less than K or less than equal to be actually or more than K if it is more than K then we have to discard characters so we have to keep on discarding characters till the size again becomes less than K so we have to actually run a loop so we can run a while loop while loop will be a better option because we don't have initialization as such so run a while loop till the point till the size of the hash map is more than k till it is having more than k unique characters present in the substring and discarding loop will be on the left pointer outer loop is for including which is right inner loop is for discarding which is on left and we will keep on discarding by doing the frequency minus minus so exclude the left character exclude the left character by doing frequency minus minus in hash map but check if the frequency is zero then delete the key value pair then delete the key value pair delete the key value pair also and as soon as the size becomes less than equal to k we can say that we are able to get the substring with valid conditions so stop the loop so after the loop is done and actually while we are excluding the character we also have to do left pointer plus plus because we will keep on discarding the Next next index after this loop is done. We are having a valid substring. So we will take the substring length to check the substring length check if the length of substring. That is nothing but what that is nothing but right minus left plus one as discussed in the dry run is a more than answer or not is greater than answer if yes update the answer update answer as length as right minus left plus one itself. But after doing it, we have to also basically just return the answer that is finally when we are able to get the longest of thing. You will return it the length only so we have already discussed the instruction manual using that we will be writing the code in Java programming language. So let's just directly jump on to it. So we have to first of all create a hash map as you can see in the instruction manual having the key as character having the value as integer. Let's say the hash map name is atom and what we need. to do is initially hashmap will be empty. We need to set two pointers left pointer and right pointer. All the right pointer will be within the loop left pointer. We can set it outside the loop because it will be sometimes updated. We sometimes have to discard characters and also the answer variable which will show the maximum length the longest length will be at 0th index only that is not the zero index, but the zero length empty length. And right pointer we will run a loop because we can have a right pointer every time including a character so we can have a simple for loop for it. So right pointer will be just having a for loop going to eat and every index from 0 till string dot length and we will one by one included the character at right by just doing the frequency of that character plus plus so we will get the frequency whatever the frequency is we will do frequency plus 1 and if the frequency is not present, you have to consider it at 0. So what we will do is we will say HM dot. what means insert or update the frequency of the character the character is s dot care at right the character at right this is the function in java what should be the new frequency the new frequency should be the old frequency for same character plus one so for that we can store it in a variable old which will be the hm dot get old frequency of the same character s dot caret right but if the character does not exist what does java do is java will return you null if the character does not exist it will give you null value instead of zero value although in other languages it will give you zero so if you want to get zero you have to use instead of get you have to use get or default function and in that case you have to pass a second parameter the default value which you should get if the key is not present and the value which we are trying to get is zero if the key is not present so we will get the value zero whatever the old value is we have to do the frequency plus plus by making old plus one as the new frequency. So these two lines will do the frequency of the character at right plus plus that is included. But after including it, we also have to check whether we have included more than K characters or not more than K different characters or not. So for that, if the number of characters which are included are more than K, then we have to discard them and how we can check the number of characters which are included by getting the size of the hash map. If the size of hash map is more than K, now the point is we have to discard characters exclude characters using left and for discarding we can do the same thing as done here. But instead of just making the frequency as the character at right we have to do at character at left. Similarly, at the next line also, instead of the right character, we have to do left character, but old frequency should become minus minus old frequency minus one, but one more. point is that if the new frequency is becoming zero in that case, we have to delete it also. So when it will become zero, if I will say old minus one is zero. If old minus one is zero or you can say old is the one that is after updating, it will become zero. In that case, delete the character also. So we can say HM dot removed might be the function name which will remove the character at left. But if even if we are removing it, we are not removing it, that does not matter. We will always do left pointer plus plus because we have discarded it anyways. And once we are able to get the substring with valid characters only K at most distinct characters, we will check whether the current substring is of maximum length or not. So if right minus left plus one is more than the answer, what we will do is update the answer. Answer will be right minus left plus one or you can also use maximum function. So let's do what let's just return answer and see if it is going to pass all the desk cases or not why because there might be some corner cases also which we need to take care of or maybe they are already taken care of that we need to see so it is taking some time to run hopefully it should give no errors but there is a small error in the hash map name there is nothing like hash map with M small we have to make a hash map with M capital H capital M capital in Java let's run it again and this time hopefully there should be no other error okay actually there are multiple errors first error is the variable old is already defined so what we can do instead of storing it this time inside the inner loop we can say that now we don't need to use get or default we can just directly get the old frequency by using get function because we are sure it will be present in the substring because it was already included we are just when we are discarding it was already included so we can get the old frequency by using HM dot get the s dot caret left because it will already be present so no need to use the default value it will never give you nothing and there was one more error which was regarding the left or right pointer let's just run it again to see if there is any other errors or not so there is some error with regards to answer variable so ans is not existing actually the variable name is answer not ans only so let's change the variable name with the complete name so these are small some like small errors with regards to data types or variables or the syntax errors only although when we run it we are getting a null pointer exception and why it is getting a null pointer exception that we have to see we are getting the old frequency of the character if the old frequency does not exist have to take it zero and put the characters new frequency as the old frequency plus one and if the hash hash map size is more than k in that case we have to put the character at left with the old frequency of the character minus one but now check whether the old is one but old variable is the outer old variable we have to check it for the inner thing so for that we can actually use the get function whether the frequency is zero that is hm dot get the s dot care at left the characters at left frequency is it zero now after updating we have to check for zero only then remove it so hopefully it should not give me null point reception now because we were wrongly comparing the old variable so as you can see it is giving me three for the sample input let's just submit it and check whether it is going to pass all the test cases or not it is taking some time to run there might be a lot of test cases And as you can see all the 31 test cases including the corner cases, base cases, everything is getting fast and this is the code taking how much time complexity we are running a loop over the string of length n inside that we are running another loop. But even though there are two loops, they are not dependent on each other. They are not running in a fashion that whenever outer loop will run, inner loop will run completely. This loop is also running for n times, independently this loop is also running for n times. Both the pointers left and right will just complete the iteration once. They will never come back to the previous index. They will never move backward. So n plus n will be the overall time complexity. Why? Because get or default, put, get, all these functions, even remove, all these functions will be average case constant in nature. And since all these operations are constant, overall time will be only due to the loop which is only you can say linear. times linear is still linear but when it comes to space if there are 256 different types of characters if you are including only a style characters so there will be the space complexity as order of 256 although if you don't say that there are only a style characters if there are more characters also unicodes also or if there are instead of string if there is an integer array in that case you can say the hash map space will be linear it is just a matter of perspective how you are thinking so due to hash map there is extra space there is auxiliary data sector for sure so with that we are done with the problem longest of string with at most k distinct characters you can try to do a try run using this code on different test cases on having test cases with some corner scenarios also and i think you will be able to get the logic"

        "transcription": "Hi everyone. Welcome back in this particular video. We will be discussing the problem fizzbuzz. What we are given is a program. What we have to write is a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n that is all the numbers from 1 to n should be printed in a string kind of manner. But what is the scenario or what is the constraint because if it is just printing 1 to n in numbers, then you can easily do it the scenario is or multiples of 3 that is 3 6 9 12 and so on you should print fizz instead of the number itself. Similarly for the multiples of 5 you should print buzz instead of the number itself that is instead of 3 6 9 and so on you will have to print fizz instead of 3 6 9 itself and instead of 5 10 and so on you will have to print buzz but there is one more very important. criteria that for the numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 they should be having fizz buzz getting printed not 3 or not 5 or actually not fizz not only buzz and not also the number itself and of course if nothing is mentioned for the numbers which are neither multiples of 3 nor multiples of 5 then they will be printed as it is that is a number itself. You can also take a example input to understand the problem statement. If input is 15 that is we have to print first 15 natural numbers from 1 to 15 but according to the constraints what will be the output 1 why because 1 is neither a multiple of 3 nor a multiple of 5 2 is also not a multiple of 3 not a multiple of 5 so same numbers will get printed 1 and 2 but when it comes to 3 fizz will be printed because 3 is only a multiple of 3 not a multiple of 5 what about 4 neither 3 nor 5 what about 5 it will be a multiple of only 5 not 3 so buzz is printed. What about six? Only a multiple of three, seven, neither eight, neither multiple of you can say multiple of three or multiple of five. But what about nine? Only three. What about 10? It is only a multiple of five, 11, neither of both phase. You can say it is for 12. That is only a multiple of three, 13, 14, as usual, neither multiple of both three and five. But when it comes to 15 itself, then it's output should be phase bus instead of just phase or just a bus or the number, because it is multiple of both three and five 15 is a multiple of both. So what can be the approach to solve this problem? Given any end and can be in the range from one till 10 is for five or six, whatever it is. So in can be very large also. Obviously one thing which is most probably coming to everyone's mind is we have to do iteration. We have to run a loop over each of the numbers starting from one going till n. increment by one one one at a time that is start the loop from one uh iterator maybe or a counter maybe starting from one incrementing one by one that is going to two three four and so on up till up till n the last number should be n but based on certain conditions based on certain criterias we will have to check whether the number is a multiple of three or five or both and according to that we have to print accordingly or you can say we have to output the number or return the number accordingly return the string accordingly so what can be one of the approaches to solve this problem one of the approaches will be just do whatever it is asked that is we will run a loop over each of the numbers so let's say we are starting the loop from one we will check is one only a multiple of three only a multiple of five multiple of both or neither so how can you check whether the number is a multiple of some other number if it comes in that table on dividing the number by whatever you want to test it with if you will divide it by that number the remainder should come out to be zero let's say if i am saying that 12 is a multiple of three what do you mean by that it means when you will divide 12 by three the remainder will come out to be zero that is 12 modulus 3 modulus is the remainder operator or module operator it should come out to be zero value because the remainder is zero it is completely able to divide 12 so 12 is a multiple of 3 or 3 is a divisor of 12 so what i have to check is is one a multiple of 3 one is not a multiple of 3 what about multiple of 5 is 1 a multiple of 5 that is 1 modulus 5 equal to 0 no it is not equal to 0 since both of these values are not equal to 0 one should be printed as it is so what we can do is we can have a condition where if the number modulus 3 is also not equal to 0 as well as number modulus 5 is also not equal to 0 print the number similarly you will do for 2 why will you do it for 2 in the same fashion as 2 modulus 3 is also not equal to 0 as well as 2 modulus 5 is also not equal to 0 so similar as the before that is similar as 1 you will print the number itself but when it comes to the number 3 what about 3 the number 3 modulus 3 will come out to be 0 that is it is a multiple of 3 but what about the number 5 is it a multiple of 5 no so those numbers who are only multiple of 3 should be printed as a fizz and if let's say if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5 in that case it should not be only fizz it should be actually fizzbuzz so in case of 3 we are printing fizz similarly you will say for 6 you will say for 9 you will say for 12 the same output will be there and let me just write only one time for these particular numbers so for these particular numbers like let's say instead of x instead of 2 or 1 I am writing x right now it can be generic anything so what is the condition we will say when we have to print the number itself that is is in the scenario in the condition when the number is not a multiple of three as well as not a multiple of five. So examples will be one, two, four, and let's say seven and so on. And the second scenario which we discuss is if the number is only getting divided by three not getting divided by five, let's say X is the number. So you will have to print this. What about the numbers which are multiple of five that is 510 and and so on. In that case, what you will do is you will check the divisibility by three. Obviously, it will come out to be not equal to zero because we don't have to print. Only buzz in case of multiples of both three and five. So it should not be a multiple of three, but it should be a multiple of five. That is the division by five will give you zero. In this case, it is not equal to zero. In this case, it is equal to zero and output will be bus. That is for five only multiple of five bus and only multiple of five bus. And when it comes to numbers like 15, 30 and so on. you have two types of conditions which you can write one smart condition is just check whether x modulus 15 is equal to 0 or not because if a number is multiple of both 3 and 5 obviously it will be multiple of 15 it is bound to happen or what you can do is you can just go in the same fashion that is x modulus 3 is equal to 0 it is a multiple of 3 as well as x modulus 5 is equal to 0 it is also a multiple of 5 if it is multiple of both then you will have to print the fizzbuzz so let's just say in this case we will print fizzbuzz so these will be the four if else conditions or you can say a if else if ladder will be required and accordingly we will print inside a loop what will be the time complexity of this approach time complexity is obviously the best you can't do further better in the terms of time complexity you will have to run a loop over each number from 1 to n writing this if else will be constant operation so overall time will be linear where n is the number which is given to you input. What about space? We are actually not requiring any extra space because if we will consider the output return type which is a string array we never consider the input data structures as well as the output data structures in extra space when we say space it generally means only the extra space complexity the auxiliary data structures which you are creating which in this question will be nothing you will just require a loop having a single variable a iterator from one to n so four bytes that's it so linear time constraint space but the point is can you better do than the first approach which we have discussed answer is not in terms of time and space complexity this is the best one but in terms of the atomic operations or in terms of the operations time complexity what we are doing right now is we are doing modulus operations or you can say the and operators every time and these operators will be a little bit more time taking than maybe incrementing a number or maybe decrementing a number. So a slightly better algorithm, which some of the interviewers might expect, it is not like all of the interviewers will expect, but some of the interviewers will expect a better solution will be to not use the modulus operator, to not use the division operator, to not use the and operator. And in such a scenario, what you have to do is for each of the tracking purpose, whether the number is a multiple of three, whether the number is multiple of five, you will have to maintain a count variable. That is what is the current state for the third number. That is every third number should be a multiple of three, three, six, nine, and so on. Every fifth number will be a multiple of five. So we will track a count for the multiple of three and for the multiple of five, as soon as the counter reaches three, three, three, we will say that yes, the number is a multiple of three. Why? Because we will make the count from one go to two, go to three and then again. back to 1, 4 to 2, 4 to 3 again come back to 1 or you can say again come back to 0 if we are starting with 0. So in that fashion, we will be able to maintain the count and just compare count is equals to 3 or not. Similarly, for 5, we will start the count with 1 for the 5 variable and we will say as soon as the count reaches 5, that is the point when the output will be buzzed and when you can say the count reaches both for the first count reaches 3 and the second variables count reaches 5, then we have to print fizzbuzz. So let's quickly do a dry run for the second approach, a slightly better approach, which some introverts will expect. Initially count of 3 variable, let's say the variable names are count 3 and count 5. You can name the variables anything as you want. Initially I am saying both are starting with 0. Now first number 1 will be there, obviously loop will be same, nothing is going to change in terms of the for loop or in terms of the while loop which you are going to use. So as soon as you enter the for loop, first thing you should do is you should increment both the numbers the count of three and the count of five. Now check is a count of three equal to three. No, it is not equal to three. How about count of five equal to five? No, it is not equal to five. So print the number as it is. Don't no need to change anything. What about to since first you will increment the count for three variable increment the count for five variable. This is not equal to three because it is not a multiple of three. This is not equal to five because the number two is not a multiple of five. So print the number as it is. But what about the number three first as soon as you are entering the for loop? What is the point which you are doing is incrementing both the variables because they are maintaining the count. And now if you will see that three is equals to equals to three it means the every third number should be a multiple of three. So this is the first you can say multiple of three which is going to be there and in that scenario what we have to print is only phase why because this number is not equal to five. When both are equal to five then you have to print. variables right now it is only this then what about four you will say before going to four what do you have to do is again make this variable become back to zero otherwise you can't track that count should be equal to three or six or nine you will have to again start the counting or again start the tracker from zero as soon as it reaches three in the first case as soon as it reaches five in the second case so what you will do is while going inside the function count for three variable increment by one count for four variable increment by one is it equal to three no this is not equal to three is it equal to five no this is not equal to five so four is not a multiple of both three and five so print four as it is but as soon as you will go to five what will happen is you will see that this number is only two it is not equal to three it is not a multiple of three it is not every third number after three the next multiple of three will be six but when we increment the count for five yes now it is equal to to 5 and if it is equal to 5 you will have to print only buzz because only the number is a multiple of 5 not both 3 and 5 but when you will repeat this process again and again first of course what you have to do since the count of 5 is equal to 5 again set it to 0 but don't set the count of 3 to 0 this process will go on 1 by 1 1 by 1 for each number I am directly skipping to the number which is going to be 15 in case of 15 what will you see is after incrementing both the count of 3 will be equal to 3 and the count of 5 will be equivalent to 5 and in such a scenario what you have to check is is a count of 3 equal to 3 as well as count of 5 is equal to 5 you will have to print both fizzbuzz or maybe instead of doing like and operator what you can do is you can provide a if if condition instead of if else because if you will just provide two ifs it is going to be executed one after the other even if both conditions are true both will get executed so Let's do what let's now discuss the instruction manual although in the instruction manual I will be using and operators but without the use of modulus operator or without the use of division because addition or subtraction is lesser time consuming in terms of atomic operations than the division or multiplication. So what we have to do is we have to first of all create an array of outputs and that to array of strings to create a array of strings containing what containing initially empty strings or null whatever you want of size what so let's not write containing something. Let's just say create an array of strings of size n irrespective of whatever it will contain initially it will anyways get updated. Create two tracker variables create two counters one will be count of three and count of five both set at zero initially both will be initialized with zero variable and now is the point when we are starting. in the for loop. So let's write a for loop. What we will be doing is run a loop or a run a iteration over all the elements over elements one till n using a loop incrementing by one at a time. I am not writing that much description. I hope it is self-understood what we have to do every time is we have to check what is the number of count of three and count of five. So first condition is if let's say the count of three. Is equals to three equals three as well as as well as count of five equals five and when we say as well as it is nothing but the and operator only one times and operator will be used instead of four times using it. So if it is a multiple of both three and five we have to do what we have to print or you can say add the output. Yeah. as the fizzbuzz for the current index for the current element. But if let's say it is not multiple of both 3 and 5 in that scenario. What we have to do is if let's say it is only a multiple of 3 not a multiple of 5. So if it is only count of 3 equals to 3 add the output as only fizz not fizzbuzz for the current element. However, if vice versa that is it is only a multiple of 5 else if count of 5 is only equals to 5 only add buzz not fizz or not fizzbuzz both add the output as buzz for the current element. And finally what we will say is if let's say it is not both multiples of 3 and 5 neither of them then we have to add the element itself then add the element itself in the output array in the output, but we have to make sure that we are updating these. variables of count 3 and count 5 how do we have to do it first what we have to do is as soon as we enter the loop increment both count 3 and count 5 by plus 1 that is count 3 getting incremented by 1 count 5 getting incremented by 1 however let's say if count 3 reaches 3 then what we have to do is we have to make it back to 0 but in this case since count 5 is also equal to 5 we have to make the count 5 also set back to 0 in this scenario only count 3 should be set back to 0 and similarly in this scenario only count 5 should be set back to 0 however in the last scenario when neither of them is equal to 3 or 5 then we don't have to set them back to 0 only resetting will happen once we are able to reach every third number for count 3 every fifth number for count 5 so this entire code is the better code in terms of the atomic operations which we are using that are not division or modulus but we are using some count based approach which is still linear time complexity still constant space complexity but a good solution for an interview. We will be writing the code for the problem fizzbuzz in java programming language. So what we have to do in this problem is create an array of strings because the output will be containing either the numbers or fizz or buzz or both fizzbuzz. So that's why we require an array of strings. Of what size? Of the same size as the n variable which we are getting in the input. So initially this string array will be containing null values however we don't care because we will be updating the values. So string array of n size initially each index will be having nulls. Now that we discussed in the optimizer solution or in a different way of writing the code using the counter based approach that we have to create two variables, two counters, one for count of 3 and one for count of 5 both initially starting from 0. If you have not watched the first video please watch that otherwise this approach will not be clear to you. What we have to do in the code is run a for loop preferably over all the elements from 1 till n so that we can check whether the element should be printed or phis or bus or phis bus both. So first of course as soon as we enter the for loop we have to update both the count3 as well as count5 variable because we are starting them from 0 0 so we have to make the count go like 1 2 3 1 2 3 for count3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 like this for count5 variable. That's why we as soon as we enter the for loop we will increment both of them by 1. Now check whether both the count3 and count5 are 3 and 5 respectively. That is if both the values are equal to 3 and 5 it means that the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 or you can say it is a multiple of 15 and in such a scenario what we have to do is we have to first reset both the variables back to 0 but after resetting obviously we to print the output as fizzbuzz so at the same index of the output or you can say this resultant let's say this array name is res i will say at the same index we will put actually not index because index will start from one and it will go to n we have to put it at index minus one or if your language supports a dynamic array then you can also create a dynamic array however in java since the return type is a static array of fixed size i have to use indices so resultant of previous index for value one we will put the answer at zeroth index for value two we will put the element at or the answer at first index and so on that is resultant of index minus one will be equivalent to fizzbuzz and just make sure that f and b of fizzbuzz are capital otherwise answer will be wrong however if it is only the counter three is equivalent to three it means that the number is only a multiple of three not a multiple of five that is three six nine and so on in such a scenario obviously count of three should be reset that is make it back to zero but now in this scenario we will only print fizz not fizz buzz so i will just remove buzz from this similarly what you have to do is no brownie points for guessing this that is if the count is five then obviously it is a multiple of five not a multiple of three because if it is multiple of both it is already handled now we are writing else conditions that is a ladder so either this will be there or it will be like this or it will be like this it will not be multiple conditions being true if it is a multiple of five reset the count of five back to zero and add the output as only buzz not fizz buzz because it is only multiple of five however if the number is not a multiple of three not a multiple of five it is not a multiple of any one of them in that scenario what we have to do is resultant of index minus one will be the number itself that is index but since this array is a type of string and this index variable is an integer in order to store integer into a string what we have to do is either add a string which is empty into this index that is empty string plus the number will come out to be a string if i write it in the form of let's say there is a string which is empty let's say there is a number which is 16 what will happen is after adding both of them it will come out to be 16 as a string because string concatenated with integer is going to give you string only not a integer so this is one smart way or one trick to convert a integer into a string or maybe what you can use is some inbuilt function like integer dot percent or actually not integer dot percent but something like string dot value of some function will be there i do not remember exactly that's why it is better to use instead of inbuilt functions these kind of tricks which we will not help or which will not basically take help of any inbuilt functions. So now that we are done with the code, let's actually do what? Let's actually finally return the output. So return the output array that is the resultant array. If we will run this, then hopefully our output should be same for 15. That is 1, 2, fizz, 4, fizz, buzz, fizz and so on. Let's see if it is going to give me the same or not. It's taking some time to run because there might be some issues in terms of the variable name. So the variable name is not capital N, but it is small n. Let's run it again after doing the corrections. Small mistake in the naming of the variable. Still there is some issue in the index plus plus not I plus plus because the index variable is what we have initialized as IDX. It should be correct now after doing the corrections, as you can see. for 15 it is having the same output as expected output let's just do what let's just submit the code and see if it is going to work for all the scenarios however in 15 ns15 all the scenarios got automatically covered fizz fizz buzz only buzz and the number but still you can see that all the test cases after submission are also as are getting passed so the time complexity of this particular code will be linear because we are running a loop over all the n indices or over all the n elements from 1 to n and inside that for loop we are just doing a lot of if else conditions which are constant operations so overall time will be linear what about space although there is an array which is being created but this array is what we are going to return it is not an extra space when we count the space complexity or when we figure out the space complexity we don't include generally the input and the output we only talk about extra space or auxiliary data structures so the space complexity for this particular code is going to be constant in nature. Linear time constant space is the solution for face bus problem which we did without doing any division or modulus which is a very good interview question."

        "transcription": "In this video, you're going to perform an activity with typeof operator. So you will be given three values and before you execute them on your repellent, you have to identify what is going to be their data types. Okay, so here are the three values in front of you. Console.log of typeof of hello, then a console.log of typeof of 10, then console.log of typeof of false. So pause this video now, you can have all of these three lines pasted on your repellent and after that, before you execute it, you have to first identify for yourself that what are going to be the data types of each of these values. So pause the video now and I'll be seeing you very shortly. Alright, so by now, if you've already solved this activity, this is going to be simple. You have to check the data type of hello. How do you do that? Well, by now, you already know. So pause the video now and I'll be seeing you very shortly.  already must be knowing that this is a string and let's verify it by the answer with type of operator as well. For that I'll be just making a new file in the activities folder. I'll just keep it as activity2.js and I'll be saying console.log of type of of hello. Let's quickly check the answer. How do I run this file? Code space the path of this file which I can take it up from here and I can paste it and I can see the answer comes out to be string. Let's go ahead and check the next one. It's going to be console.log of type of of 10. This is going to be a number. Let's quickly verify if that's the case and yes that is. That is a number. Finally console.log of type of of false. What is going to be this one? This is going to be a Boolean quickly verifying again and as you can see this is going to be a boolean. So this is how you find out the data type of any value with the help of type of operator. We are going to learn about primitive data types. Now what are primitive data types? The values which cannot be changed further are known as primitive data types. Basically these are the building blocks of the data that we prepare in JavaScript programming language. Talk about any number, talk about any sentence like cryo.do is the best place to learn. Whenever you print these kind of values you are going to be dealing with primitive data types. So the primitive values are numbers and strings among some other things as well. So in JavaScript we have a five types of primitive data types which we are going to learn today in this video. So the primitive values are going to act up as a building block for all the data types that we have available in JavaScript. So console.log of 2 or maybe. console.log of hello. All these kind of values are known as primitive data types. Okay, so some of the primitive data types that we have available in JavaScript are numbers, strings, booleans, undefined and null. So strings are nothing but a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Booleans are something which have only two possible set of values either true or false and we are going to use them for logical operations. Undefined is something which is used for unintentionally missing values and null is something which is used for intentionally missing values. Numbers are something which most of us already understand. Positive numbers, negative numbers, the integers, decimal numbers, all of those are going to be belonging to the numbers data type. Okay, so let's deep dive a bit more into it by practicing them on Repelit. So let's go back to Repelit environment and and let's create a new file for us. Okay. So right below index.js I'll make a new file. Let me just call it primitives.js. Okay. So first of all, let's talk about numbers. Right. So what all numbers are supported in JavaScript. I can say something like a console.log of two. I could have also printed a negative number. Let's say minus 78. I can also print something like console.log of 45 point something something. I could have also said console.log of negative minus 54 point something something. Right. So whether it's a positive integer, whether it's a negative integer, whether it's a positive decimal number, whether it's a negative decimal number. In all of these cases, it belongs to the number data type. All of these are going to print fine on the output and they belong to the number. number data type. So let's execute this file. First of all, I can directly say node space primitives.js and you can see all of these values got printed. Now let's also talk about strings. What are strings? As I've told you, it's a series of zero or more characters enclosed in a single or double quotes. So I can say console.log of just this thing, nothing inside the quotes. This is going to be known as an empty string, basically a string which is having zero number of characters. I can also have console.log of A, which is just a single character. We can also have console.log of cryo.do is the best place to learn. multiple characters as well. All of these characters, whether it's zero character, one character or a lot of hundreds or thousands of characters, all of them belong to the category of strings data type. Okay, all of them belong to the category of strings data type. Now all of them have to be enclosed in either a single quote or a double quote. I'll just add note over here, enclosed, enclosed in single quotes or double quotes. So I can keep them in double quotes or I can also keep them in single quotes. Okay. All you have to make sure is if you have started with a single code, end it with a single code and the same logic goes for your double quotes as well. The enclosing can either be in a single quote or a double quote. Let's print them as well. And as you can see, all of these values are also getting printed. It also prints the empty string for which you can see this empty space. So nothing is getting printed for that. part. Let's talk about booleans now. So booleans are mostly going to be used for your logical operations and they have only two set of possible values. Either something can be true or something can be false. So let's see. Let me clear the shell and let's print this again. And as you can see, these values are also getting printed totally fine. These are going to be known as booleans. Now, what do I mean by logical operations for the same? Well, it is going to be something like, you know, you're going to compare some values on the basis of which either it can be true or it can be a false. Okay. Let's also talk about undefined. Now we are saying that undefined is used for unintentionally missing values and null is used for intentionally missing values. So what do we mean by these two things? Unintentional and intentional. Basically whenever we are going to declare any kind of variables, we need to store some values into them, right? So let's say if you have declared a variable by saying let A, but you haven't given any value for this variable A, in all of these cases, JavaScript is going to allot a default value to this variable, which is known as undefined. So in all such cases where you have a variable declared, but the value is not given from our side, default value given by JavaScript is known as undefined, okay? And whenever we have to initialize a variable on our end, but you don't know its value currently, you can always initialize the value to null. So here's the difference. Why did we use the keyword unintentionally missing values? So let's say you forgot giving a value to your variable A, okay? So in those cases, for those unintentionally missing values, JavaScript allots a default undefined to it, okay? So I'll just add unintentionally missing values. right? But this time I am already initializing from my end to say it as a null. I'm intentionally saying to initialize this value to null right? Now at any later stage of my program I'm totally free to update this value to something else. It can be any possible data type that you know currently. So as a good coding standard what you should always remember is that if you have to declare a variable it's always the best case to declare it with a null if you don't know its initial value. In all such cases where you don't know the initial value always initialize it with a null and later stage of your program you can always keep on updating it as well. But undefined is something which we should not declare from our end. It should be something that should only be written by the programming language back to us. So these are the five set of primitive data types that we learned. Numbers, strings, booleans, undefined and null. Okay, now how do we check the data type of these? We are surely able to print these values on the output, but how do I check the data type of each of these values? Can we do that in JavaScript? Yes, we can. So for that we have an operator which is known as type of operator. We write it together itself. There is no space between them. So the type of operator returns a string indicating the type of the operands value. Okay, so let me show you a demo right on Repl.it. So as you can see, we can check type of all of these values in order to get their data type in which they belong to. Let's go ahead and do a demo for the same as well. Okay, so moving back to Repl.it, for all these values that we have printed, let's also try to print their data types now. Okay, so I'll just copy all these values. values. I'll paste them down again. And at all these places, I'll just be adding a type of. Okay. And I'll also be closing them. Okay. I think there was a bracket over here. This should be type of and you simply have to just encapsulate your value under a type of operator. Okay. So let's just add the brackets at all other places as well. And let's print all these values. Okay. I think there's one more missing bracket. That should be just this part. Okay. Let's print this again. And as you can see, for all these four lines, the data type which came out to be was number. So this is the reason I've told you whether it's a positive or a negative integer, whether it's a positive decimal or a negative decimal. In all such cases, the data type that we receive is going to be a number. Alright, let's also do the same for strings. Let me just do it for one of them. So I can say console.log of typeof of a string. Let's see what is the data type that we receive. And as you can see, this time it is clearly a string. Similarly let's also do it for console.log of typeof of true. What do we get in this case? You can see it's a Boolean this time. We can also be checking your typeof of this variable, which is going to give you an undefined. Let's see that as well. As you can see, this time it's an undefined. So typeof is simply an operator which specifies. is the data type of the value that you pass to its brackets Okay, perfect Now there's just a quick thing that you have to remember Let's say if you have an expression like this type of type of 5 Can you guess what is going to be the answer of such case? Well let's see and let's print the answer Let us just comment everything above that we have learned since we have already understood it and let's just only see the output of this thing Let's put a semicolon here Have a look Why is it a string? Let's also talk about this So type of of 5 was going to be a number I hope you already understand that by now and type of of 5 is already a number But then what is going to be the type of number? That number is a series of characters And whenever we talk about a series of characters, what is that? It is always a string So whenever you going to check the outer type of for the inner value that is going to come out as a string and that is how whenever you're going to use your type of operator more than once in all such cases the answer is always going to be string right. So this is how we check the data type of a value."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem intersection of two arrays basic we are given two arrays a and b what we have to do we have to write a function to compute their intersection we have to find the intersection of two arrays note that each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both the arrays it means if the array one and array two have duplicate elements the resultant should also have duplicate elements but what should be the number of occurrences it can be that the first array have some number of occurrences of some element it can be that second array have some number of occurrences of that same element but in the resultant how many occurrences should we need let's say in the first array the number of occurrences of a value b is b1 and the number of occurrences of value v in the second array is v2 so should we take in the output v1 number of occurrences of v or v2 that is the question that we will see from the sample input output but let's read the remaining problem first line contains one integer n denoting the number of elements in the first array a and then next n elements containing the first array values then similarly next line contains integer m representing the array size of b and then next m elements contains the array elements of b so two arrays of different size can be there and we have to find the intersection example is let's say first array is having four elements the elements are 1 2 2 1 the second array is having two elements and the values are 2 and 2 how many elements should be in the output is one intersection is one common for both the arrays no one is only present in the first array is it too common in both the arrays the answer is yes two is present in both the arrays in the first array as well as in the second array How many times should I take in the output the two is occur occurring two times in first array two is also occurring two times in second array intersection is two only two times in the output also but there might be some corner cases what are different corner cases first let's read the constraints if let's say the n and m are the sizes of both the arrays it can range from 1 till 10 is per 5 and the array of i and the b of i that is array values of both a and b can be from minus 10 is for 9 till plus 10 is for 9 it can be anything in an integer and checklist is that we have to basically follow which approach like you can read the checklist on your own but output should be in a sorted nature output should be in a sorted nature it is very very important so we will see how we can actually give the output in sorted nature in the last but before that let me just take two arrays let me take the first array first array and the second array both are individual arrays which are unsorted so let's take the first area as 2 1 or maybe 20 10 30 10 30 then let's take 50 let's take 30 then let's take maybe 50 if this is the first area let's say the second area which is B area this is a let's say the B area is maybe 10 let's say 30 let's say 30 let's say 20 let's say 20 then let's say 50 or maybe not 50 let's say 40 let's say maybe 50 only and let's say now the next value which we are having is 20 or maybe not 20 maybe 60 if this is a secondary we have to find the intersection of both areas so what is then what is the intersection of both the areas is a 20 common in both the areas yes 20 is present in the secondary but 20 is actually 2 times in the 2nd array, how many times should I take in the intersection? The minimum number of times that is the common times of common. It is only one only one time in this common not two times It is not present two times in the first array. So only one time I should take it in the output 20 then 10 is the 10 present in the secondary also yes in the first array it is present 2 times in second array. It is only present one time. So in the output again only one time it is common. So only one time 10 will come and then sorted alter that is before 20 30 Is 30 present in first array? Yes, 3 times is 30 also present in second array. Yes, but only 2 times how many times it should come in the output the minimum number of times that is 2 times only minimum of 3 comma 2 will be 2 because it is only 2 times. It is common and the third time it is not common in both the array. What about 40 is 40 present in the first array? No, although it is present in second array, but it should be in the first array as well. What about 50 50 is present in first array 2 times 50 is present in third array? second area one time minimum will be only one time. So let's take in the output only one time. Similarly. What about maybe 6060 is not present in the second in the it is present in a second area, but it is not present in the first area. So we have to not take it. So this is the output containing five values and it should also be sorted. We can sort the area in the lab. That is not a big deal. But the question is how we can figure out the common values see. One of the strategy one of the approach which you can actually use to solve it is find all the possible pairs and in order to find all the possible peers, maybe we are we have to do is first find 20. How many times it is present in the first area and then find 20 how many times it is present in the secondary and find the minimum stored in the output then again 10 how many times it is present in the first area how many times it is present in the secondary and output in the resultant accordingly. This is the resultant array, but this will be. a very hectic job this route for solution will be very hectic why because since I will ask for each and every element what is the frequency of it is the first array as well as in the second array so for each value I have to run a loop so first loop will be for all the distinct values and second loop will be to find the frequency in both the array so it actually will go in how much time complexity it will actually go in at least quadratic time complexity if you will try to use some data sectors but is there any better solution better than quadratic time complexity better than n square time complexity no need to run nested loop 20 how many occurrences are there 10 how many occurrences are there 30 how many occurrences are there instead of asking for each and every value how many occurrences are there is there any better thing can we just run a loop on distinct values and yes the answer is we can store how many times each value is present we can store how many times 20 is present how many times 10 is present how many times 30 is present how many times 50 is present the first array and also in the second array but no need to actually store in the second array we can just store the frequencies of each value present in the first array in some kind of key value pair. Why? Key will be the element that is for which the frequency is getting stored and value will be the frequency of that element that is example is 20 comma 1. 20 is having frequency 1. 10 comma 2. 10 is having frequency 2 in the first array. 30 comma 3. 30 is having 3 frequency in the first array and so on. So what we will do in the optimized approach we will store the key value pair for the first array. Now what we have to do with that first of all let me just make fatafat let me just make quickly the element comma frequency that is key value pair for the first array that is 20 is having one frequency 10 is having two frequency then similarly you can have 30 having how much frequency 30 having 3 frequency 40 is having no frequency so we will not store it obviously and finally 50 is having 2 frequency but where should we store it where should we store these key value pairs the best data structure in every programming language to store key value pairs is a hash map or you can say a map or you can say unordered map the name is different but the concept is the hashing algorithm so we can create a key value pair database or we can say key value pair data store and particularly that hash map data structure in that data structure we can store all the elements along with their frequencies so initially 20 will be having 0 frequency we will do the frequency plus plus initially 10 will be also having 0 frequency so 0 will become 1 and then again 10 will come 1 will become 2 similarly for 30 initially it will be having 0 frequency when it will come first time frequency plus plus when it comes second time frequency plus plus when it comes third time frequency plus plus same goes for the 50 element we will run a loop on the input array and build this frequency add build this frequency hash map once this is built now the job is very easy see I will now run a loop on second array why because I want the element to be present in both array I will ask is it 10 present in the first array without actually running a loop I can now ask from the hash map itself I will now ask from the key value database or data structure itself is it 10 present answer is yes how many times two times I want at least for now one time so yes since 10 is present 10 should be printed in the output it should be stored in the output so I will store 10 but next time 10 should come I will say that next time how many occurrences of first array are not taken right now we have two occurrences of 10 in the first array we have matched one of the occurrence of the B with the A so only one occurrence is remaining so I will do the frequency minus minus also so when we will have a matching when we will found a matching we will print it in the output we will store in the output and we will do the frequency minus minus while running the loop on first array we were doing frequency plus plus while running on the second array the loop on the second array we will do the frequency minus minus 30 is 30 present in the first array yes frequency is more than zero more than zero means it is present so print 30 at least for one time and since it is matched for one time what we can do we can just simply say frequency minus minus now only two 30s are remaining two 30s are now yet to be matched again 30 is coming yes it is still more than zero so again you can print 30 in the output although we do not want output in random order we want it in sorted order we can sort the output finally after the all the dry run after all the basically both the loops that is the loop on a as well as on b we will sort the array that is not a big deal but first let's make the dry run complete so we have taken the second 30 also because it is also common and we will again do the frequency minus minus what about 20 is 20 present in the first area yes it is so take 20 and since i have taken 20 it is matched i will do the frequency minus minus it will become zero now that is in first area no more 20 is present actually so as soon as the second 20 comes in the secondary is there any 20 present in the first area no it is zero frequency zero frequency means not present so this second 20 can't be matched and if it can't be matched i cannot take it so it is unmatched so do not add it in the output what about 40 is 40 present no 40 is not present at all in the first area it is not present in the hash map means the frequency is zero so do not take 40 also what about 50 is 50 present in the first area yes two occurrences i can take one of them i can take one of the occurrences it is matched since i have taken one of the occurrence i will print it i will do the frequency minus minus in the hash map finally 60 is 60 present in the hash map no it means it is not present in the array first array so it is not common so we found five elements to be common although we found in random order we have to sort this order so we can finally sort the resultant array but what will be the overall time complexity and the space complexity of this optimized approach previous solution was taking quadratic time but since now we are running a loop on first array plus a loop on the second array it will take n plus n overall 2n time complexity and what about the space complexity since we are going to take the loop or you can say actually the key value database or the data structure which is hash map we have to in worst case store order of n elements all the elements will be distinct so order n elements and actually one thing we missed in the time complexity that is we have to sort the output also so in worst case if the output also contains n elements the sorting of the output will require n log n time so 2n plus n log n it will overall come out to be n log n due to sorting because we need to be sorted can we do it in other fashion right now we have used hash map is there any alternative approach although we will not be discussing the alternative approach but the alternative approach is instead of making a hash map and then sorting the output better solution will be or not better actually a alternative solution with the same time same space will be make a sorted kind of hash map make a sorted kind of map that is sorted kind of keys if the all keys will be sorted then it will actually help me to produce the output also as sorted if all the keys will be sorted so one alternative approach which you can discuss or which you can basically try to solve on your own as a follow-up can be using tree map or it is known as a sorted map or it is only known as map in some languages so try to use a tree map try to use a binary search tree that is a sorted hash map kind of thing where all the keys will be sorted but this solution which we have right now discussed using hash map that is using key value pairs will be suffice in all of the languages all of the programming languages actually so we have discussed the approach now what we are going to do is we are going to come up to the third milestone that is writing the instruction manual as you can see that we will be given both the arrays and the sizes of both the arrays and in the output we have to return the intersection in a list or in an array so what we can do is we can initialize the resultant error list the resultant list of integers so that we can store all the values in that and it will be a dynamic array over C and just initialize the data structure create a integer versus integer data sector create a hash map of what of key and value as integers because key will be the elements of the array which are integers value will be the frequency which also is integer so key as well as value will be integer to create a hash map or empty hash map run a loop on the input array on the first input array a so run a for each loop probably on first array and we will get every time a element using a variable element that is every time we will get the value directly element what we will do with this element we will do the frequency plus plus so put the frequency of element in the hash map by plus one put the element of frequency in hash map as old frequency plus one now what is old frequency we have to actually get the old frequency so get the old frequency of element from hash map and if it is not present we should take it zero so in the bracket I am writing zero as default if it is not present in the hash map it should be zero by default that is not present at all and then put it plus one that is do the frequency plus plastic that is a once we are done with the frequency hash map once we have made your that we are having the frequencies of each and every element we can run a second loop that is a for each loop again over the second array on the second array using again the same variable name that is element but this time we will actually create the resultant so what we can do is we can create the resultant error list before the second loop directly because we will be using it in the second loop itself what we can do first get the frequency of the same element of element from hash map and if it is not present we have to take it zero again when do we have to put it in the resultant we have to put it in the resultant if this frequency is positive if the element is present then only put it in the uh resultant so if frequency is more than zero then add element in the output and also do one thing what we have to do after adding the element in the output we have to do the frequency minus minus because the element element now will be one of the pairs will be match. So remaining pairs we have to match now. So put the element frequency in the hash map as the frequency minus one the old frequency even minus one. Otherwise, if frequency is equal to zero do nothing, no need to do anything. Finally, output should be returned that is return resultant. But before returning resultant, the we can say resultant should be sorted. So sort of the resultant error list or the array using inbuilt function, every language have some inbuilt function to sort dynamic arrays. So you can sort the resultant before returning it because it is specifically mentioned in the output format, output should be sorted. So this is the pseudocode or this is the instruction manual of the problem intersection of two arrays, we will be doing the code in Java, what we have to do is we have to create a hash map of key and value both as integer. So how we can create a hash map in Java, we can say hash map with H capital M capital angular brackets integer comment. integer. It means the keys integer the values integer. Let's say the hash map name is HM is equals to new hash map angular brackets and the round bracket semicolon. This is how you create an empty hash map in Java. Once we have created an empty hash map a key value database or data structure run a for each loop on a variable element on the first array. So for int le colon a it means run a for each loop on the first array and then what we have to do we have to first get the old frequency. So first let's say old frequency is what hash map dot get is the function name to get the old frequency of the element. But according to the question it is according to the instruction manual actually it is mentioned that if the old frequency is not present if the element is not present in some languages like C++ it will give you zero but in Java if I want to take zero I have to use get or default function instead of get function and this get function will run in constant amount of time. so what will be the default value in the second parameter it will be zero the second parameter means the default value so get to the old frequency and now put the old new frequency as the HM dot put the element with the old frequency plus one that is frequency plus plus actually in some languages you can simply do HM of square bracket element plus plus but in Java you have to first get the frequency using get or default then put the frequency as old plus one once the hash map is filled we can ensure whether the hash map is properly filled or not by just printing the hash map itself let's see what is getting printed for now we have to return something so we will return an empty list so that is does does not give me error that we are not returning anything so we have returned something but the main thing is whether the hash map we are constructing is correct or not so for the sample input in the hash map actually we are getting one having frequency to two having frequency to for the first area yes the hash map is working properly now what we have to do now we have to initialize the resultant of integers list of integer result is equal to new arr list the arr list integer so that we can store the intersection value in it now run the loop on the second array because we have to find the intersection in both the arrays a for-ish loop particularly so run a for-ish loop on the second array but this time get the frequency from the same hash map so you can say frequency dot h m frequency is equal to h m dot get or default the frequency which is of the value what of the value element and the frequency if it is not present it should be taken as zero the default so what is the frequency if it is greater than zero then only take it otherwise do not take it if it is greater than zero then what we have to do we have to do two things first of all take the element in the output so result dot add the element in the output but also put the frequency as minus 1 so HM dot put the element with frequency minus 1 that is decrease the frequency because one pair is matched if I will not sort the array if I will directly just return the same array let's see what will happen and there is one point remaining from the instruction manual which is sorting the resultant array but for the sample input it is actually working fine but what will happen if the first area is having four values one two three and let's say maybe not one two three one three two four and second area also having four values which is one four two three so intersection should be one two three for itself all the four values should be the intersection because it is present in both the arrays one one time the same values but output we want is one two three four output we are getting is one four three two three a wrong order why because we need sorted order so in order to sort what we can do we can just use arrays.sort and actually not dot sort. Since it is a list in order to sort a list in Java, we have to use collections dot sort because list is a collection. So collections dot sort the resultant array list and then return it. So sorting will actually require n log n as discussed in the approach video and the get function, the put function, all of these functions in average case takes constant time. So this overall loop will be linear because inside that loop the functions are constant. This loop will take linear time. So linear plus linear will be two times linear but the sorting will take n log n. So overall time complexity will be n log n because dominating is n log n over 2n. And the space complexity, since we are using a extra data sector, a hash map, we are using some extra space of linear order. So that is all about the time complexity and the space complexity. Let's wait for the correct answer to get displayed to whether we are able to satisfy all that. cases yes so that was all about the problem intersection of two arrays."

Previously, what I used to do was look into a tutorial, start to do whatever they do. I wouldn't think much about it. When I came into Cryo, it was a little bit of a paradigm shift for me. What Cryo prepares is not about doing this project, doing that project. It's about the discipline of doing the projects, how to approach the problem. At any point of your life, you have to learn new technology or new skills. Cryo teaches how to tackle those kind of situations. In a broader perspective, how do you go about a problem and how do you learn a new technological skill? Cryo has this motto called Learn by Doing. They give you an approach. So it's like an approach of how to solve a problem. It's not about the solution to a problem. It's about how to approach a problem. You'll be doing it on your own. Doing a project is a major bonus to your resume. It's what keeps you apart from the rest of the crowd because you'll have experience of hands-on design principles, design patterns, which the company expects you to do. That would be an easier process with having projects done. time for adjustment in the new company will be drastically less. You'll have the knowledge, all you have to do is you'll have to learn the ways of implementing it. The company which I am placed in currently, they expected to have a clean code architecture and also good design principles. The main interview focus was on what Cryo did, like whatever I did in Cryo. I believe that software development is somewhat like swimming, where you can't learn from YouTube tutorial. You have to get into the water to get more about it. Whenever you get a new tech stack or whenever you get exposed to it, you want to learn a new technology or you are stuck in somewhere of your current technology, if you follow the approach, you'll reach your destination better than you thought of."

The thought process before joining the prior was that I wanted to learn backend as an industry level. I found which is prior doing different from the other services is that they like very much focus on, you know, doing the learning by doing itself. Basically, they give a lot of chance to code instead of just, you know, watching the tutorials and just solving some MCQs. The new things that I noticed recently, they they are more focusing on community launch their can cryo aluminium So, they are focusing on building community and also I just noticed few weeks ago they launched their open source kind of thing in which like people are posting their project and their ideas and collectively lots of students are working on. I think this is a very good initiative and this is quite different from other so that's what I like. When I started, when you see the tutorial and do the basic thing then it looks okay and then when you start doing the actual building the project, sometimes it becomes very overwhelming doing it for the first time. So, I feel that for the first module, second module and then slightly when you start building it by getting help from TAs or the mentors then you will realize that at the end of the project when you finish it then you like get a good feeling of like you have built something. Lots of mentors, their concept was very clear and like unlike other platforms we can like personalize. get connected to them and discuss like other doubts and they are very supportive in discussing that also. That's a good thing. And I like it's very exciting to learn this and especially when you have something like prior to, you know, which is very reliable and you get a hands-on experience also. So that's give a very good confidence that makes the learning process more exciting. Yeah, I would like to say that sometimes you you learn the tutes and you do not practice it and then you do not get the full confidence and then the things get lost. So I want to say that please try to do the modules at the either starting you will feel very overwhelmed and then try to take a QA helps and other mentor helps and try to do maybe you can choose a slow pace and like do do on your own pace, but try to finish it.

        "transcription": "In this video, let us now try to understand what are HTML paragraphs and line breaks. And to understand the same, let us now go through one use case. So let us say we have a requirement where we want to add a series of sentences in a web page. Now is there a predefined tag to do this or we'll have to do it in some other technical way is what we need to find out. Well, yes, we do have some tags available in HTML to solve this for us, which are known as the p tags standing up for the paragraphs and br tag for the line breaks. So let us see how exactly we are going to do the same. So we are going to have most of the HTML pages having the blocks of text in the form of paragraphs, right? Now to add paragraphs of text to our web page, we are going to make use of p tag, p stands for paragraph. Now browsers are always going to add some vertical whites. space before and after the paragraph block. So you'll always have some vertical spacing before and after your paragraph block that you're going to write under your p tags. Now this is an example of how do you write your paragraph. So enclosed under a p tag, you can write all the content as per your expectation. Now if I'm going to write multiple p tags, all of them are always going to start on a new line by default. But what will happen if you want a paragraph where you don't want to introduce another p tag, but still you want to change it to a new line? Well, in that case you can introduce a br tag. Now with the help of br tag, it stands for a line break. So if you see this kind of an example this time, what is going to happen is you can put a br tag at the end of your statement so that whatever you're going to write after this particular tag is going to appear on the very next line. So let me show you both of these examples. code sandbox so that you can understand this better. So let's visit code sandbox once and on code sandbox, we'll already have a template prepared for us so that we can understand this with the help of the same examples as discussed. So in the body tag, what I'm going to do is let me have a p tag. I'm going to write this is a paragraph. I'm going to close the p tag. Let me probably write one more p tag. Let me say cryo.do is the best place to learn. Now if I close the p tag, let us first of all see what is the output of this kind of a scenario. And as you can see, both the paragraphs which are containing the content as this is a paragraph and cryo.do is the best place to learn respectively, are coming under separate lines, as well as there is a vertical spacing between them. It's not just one after the other. There is a vertical spacing between both of these lines. But what if I don't want to change my paragraph and I want to still continue in the same p tag, but come on to a new line? How can I do that? Well, we can easily do that with the help of a br tag. So I've commented the above code and let us now try to see the example of that. So I can say this is the first line after which I want to put a br tag, br. And on the very next line I want to say this is the second line and now I can close my p tag. If I do this, now as you can see there is no vertical spacing between both of these lines because we are still under the same paragraph tag. The only difference we have made this time is we have introduced a br tag. What did this br do? After this particular thing, this is the first line, you have added a break. So whatever content is going to be available after this br tag, tag now has to move to the next line without any vertical spacing, which is the difference between doing it in two paragraph tags and introducing a br tag in the same paragraph tag. So this is exactly how the paragraphs and line breaks work in HTML. There's one very important thing to remember over here. Over here, we also have some kind of tags which do not need an opening and closing. And one such example you can see over here is br tag. We can also call this as a self-closing tag. So in br, you don't need any opening or closing. We have this kind of a syntax. You add a forward slash after the name of the tag. Such kind of tags are known as self-closing tags. You only need to put it one time. So this is exactly how the HTML paragraphs and line breaks are expected to work."

I think the Hiring remains same. I think whether it's a Flipkart or it's a like I don't know Swiggy or even Google today I think most of these companies look for problem-solving skills, which mostly get tested through Programming assignments, right and then They look for certain design elements They are able to think abstract or be able to model things and stuff like that, right? So I think once they get hired and everyone who's inside has similar skill set at least they have basic problem-solving skills They have some design elements, right I think after that, I think some of the skill set which actually differentiates a good developer who's able to grow fast, right, who's able to really perform well are mostly around two, three things, right? I think one, I think really good developers ask a lot of why, right? I think they have a good product sense, right? I think a lot of times actually by asking a couple of why's you might actually even avoid building something, right? They don't just keep building something which is not required, right? So I think product sense is actually one thing which actually differentiates a lot of good developers, right? And second, a lot of good developers kind of try to understand the overall context in which this particular feature or a product is going to operate, right? Business context and the system context, right? A lot of times actually the provision for what is going to come, right? And if you're going to work with a good engineer, right, even if you're not thought through the requirements, the kind of questions they'll ask systematically will kind of lead you towards the right design, right? So, and third thing is, yeah. their ability to work with people right across different teams because the moment the company becomes slightly larger, their ability to communicate, give the requirements to the different teams, dependent teams, their ability to communicate with their product manager, ability to communicate with the designers, right. So I would say outside of the technical skill set, I think their ability to kind of have a good product sense, user context, and their ability to model things appropriately, right, and then their ability to kind of communicate and work with people is what I think kind of differentiates good people from average and above average people. I think one thing I can say is, right, for example, like based on whatever I have seen, I think the difference between kind of an average developer and a great developer is not like like a 1x, 2x difference, right. A lot of times actually it's minimum, like I would say 8x, 10x difference, right, right. I think you might actually save probably a couple of lakhs by paying a couple of lakhs low for an average developer. I think the cost of having an average developer versus a great developer, I have seen like literally a lot of times the difference in the way they bring the value. actually almost 8x, 10x difference. Mostly it's the questions that they ask. It's the questions they ask, otherwise you keep building something which is not required. Right. And sometimes the solutions can be very, very elegant, very, very simple. You need those really good skillset to simplify things. Right. I think, especially in engineering you can't really say like always 1 plus 1 is equal to 2. Right. So, really one good developer can actually make a lot of difference. Right."

        "transcription": "In this video, we are going to understand why do we need JavaScript. So JavaScript is one of the fundamental building blocks of web development. So it is used for creating web pages. Now whether you create a single web page or you develop a complete web application, in all of these use cases, whenever you want to add any logic to your web application, whenever you want to add some interactivity to your web application, you will be needing JavaScript for the same. It is also used for adding behavior and special effects to the web page. But what do I mean by behavior or some special effects? Let's visit the website cryo.do to understand some of these behaviors and special effects. So let me visit the website cryo.do. Over here I think you can see that there is a button sign in over here. So did you notice something? That when I...  hover upon this button, the background of the button has changed. Also the color of the text sign-in has also changed. Now you must be thinking that this can be handled by CSS. Well not just from CSS, this is also possible to be handled from JavaScript. JavaScript allows you to access these elements in the DOM and you can also manipulate the properties of these elements right through JavaScript. Not just this, let me scroll down a bit and you can see a section over here where I have two icons. One is for the previous, another one is for the next. So when I click on this next icon, you can see this whole carousel slider moving. And it is showing me the very next cards which are available to be shown. So how do you think this exactly must be working? On a high level if I talk about it, on click of this next icon, there must be some event or a function. which is getting triggered. So as soon as I click on this particular icon, there is a function which is getting triggered, which makes this slider to move ahead. And that is exactly how JavaScript helps us again. So for all behavioral aspects and all the special effects that you see on a website, JavaScript can easily control that. Coming back to the presentation, you also have implementing complex features on the web page. Now what are these complex features? Well, there can be infinite use cases of that. If I again visit the website cryo.do, let's go to the button, book your free trial now. If I click on this button, you can see that there is a pop-up opening up. So again, there must have been a click event for this button, which helps us opening this function, which is again handled by JavaScript. Not just that, once you're going to fill in this form with with your name, educational qualification, your working status, your workshop slot. Once you click on this book, your free trial, all of these details must be getting stored on some kind of a server or a database, right? Can JavaScript help over there as well? Of course, yes. So JavaScript is also helpful in submitting your form data, right? So over there also, we are going to make use of JavaScript. So all such kinds of complex features, not just this, let's talk about your Gmail web application. Now, whenever a new mail arrives on your Gmail web application, do you have to manually refresh it? Not at all. It automatically takes care of that and it automatically refreshes and gives you a new email. Whenever you visit your favorite applications like Instagram, once you click on Instagram and let's say you're keeping on scrolling for the next 30 minutes, all of that data will keep on loading on its own. You don't have to manually refresh. the application to get the new set of data over there. So for all of these kind of complex functionalities also, we are going to make use of JavaScript for the same."

So my subjects were mainly CS subjects and also because the projects I worked on and the hackathons I participated in were all software projects and software hackathons, that's how I got into coding. Unfortunately, I couldn't continue that similar interest. So that's why I turned to crime. I wanted to learn new things, be there with what the future holds. I learned a lot of things with cryo, right from basically what is JavaScript and what is HTTP and how actually websites communicate right from there to how actually API is made. So I have learned really extensive things with cryo, uh, the take home assignments and the projects when we have to build everything on our own and then pass the test cases, understanding what is required of us, making a structure of it, what. we have to actually do how can I proceed like how can I approach this problem? So that's what I enjoy doing it on my own. Cryos projects aren't some projects that we do in our college or something. I feel these projects which are completed while in my cryos program were like industry standard projects because the interviewers to my company were also impressed that you know, I have made such an extensive website which covers all the test cases. I can make or build websites or work on any project. I want I have gained this confidence because of cryos."

And no kidding, it sparked such a huge interest of coding inside me. My name is Shubdeep Das. I've graduated from VIT Vello in B.Tech. And I just got placed in Cardio Track in Bengaluru. Me getting a job, one of the major part of it was Cryo, that I started to learn it on my own. And throughout the first, I would say, the three, four months of just when we are learning everything from scratch, from JavaScript, from HTML, CSS, to React, and everything, all the projects, it's such an interesting way to learn the language. Now, everything that I want to learn, I just make it into a project, and I just do it. It's an amazing process through which I learned. And the placement process was also so helpful and so thorough regarding everything. So I had the customer success managers, which I had. All of them were so wonderful. Whenever I needed help, all of them, like. responded to me very quickly and always solved my issues this was such a well thought and well guided path for the whole thing it was just wonderful the major thing that i would want to mention is ajosa when i first learned javascript i'm not even kidding it's like it it's like the concepts that he taught never i have to like rethink about them they are like so engraved inside my head like the people who are actually doing the coding are the people who are going to come out with a way of actually teaching it so that that's the major difference i would say is that the mentors in cryo and the whole curriculum about doing things stumble upon the problems and then understand how they are done till now i remember how i have encountered each and every problem how i've solved them how real world projects are made how things are done focus on thinking like a programmer ask whoever you're asking the doubt it's not about syntaxes it's not about anything it's about how you build your logic i loved everything that And I didn't cry, man."

Okay. There was DSA 1, 2, 3, and DSA 3 Lite. So I just followed those. So, around 125. For you? I think I've done close to 130, 140 questions. After tracking the interview, I've stopped. What about you? 135. 135. I also believe that if you have to cover up all the concepts, I think 150 is standard. Yeah, if you don't know DSA from the basic, then you have to, that's a different story. But if you're preparing, I think covering up 150 around should be sufficient because the concepts are very limited. The only thing that I'll say everyone is, don't mug up every question. Any question that you do, do not mug up. Instead of it, take concepts that will actually help you. So if you take 150 concepts from 150 problems, that actually covers most of the things."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, in this video we will be discussing the problem find indices of two numbers in an array which add up to a given target. We are given an array of integer as an input okay, what we have to do with it? We have to output the indices of two numbers in the array, output of two numbers, the indices of those two numbers which add up to a given target. So sum of two numbers should be equal to some specific target which should be there in the input as well. Assume we have to assume something there is some assumption given, assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you cannot use the same element twice. So one such pair whose sum will equal to target that one pair will be present exactly once only that is there will be no other pair or no other two elements whose sum will be equal to the target there will be. only one such pair but the second assumption is you cannot take the same element twice same element means the element with the same index twice you cannot take the first element as well as a second element with the same index the two elements should be having the different indices so this is also the assumption which we have to assume in the question it is specifically mentioned if a two different elements have the same value they they can be used then they can be used it means if let's say at zeroth index as well as the first index if both the indices have some same value then i can consider a pair with zeroth index and first index even though they are having same value because the indices are different so we do not need to maintain uniqueness on the values we need to maintain uniqueness on the indices every index whichever two indices we should we should pick both those indices should be different they should not be same so let's assume uh some example input is given let's take the sample input itself that is the sample input is having number of elements what are the elements the elements are 2 4 5 9 8 and as you can clearly see in the sample input there is no particular order of the value the input values can be in any order in the array so it is a unsorted array which is given to us and the target value is the third input which is target as a 7 in this case so is there any pair is there any two indices who the sum will be equal to 7 the answer is yes and it is 0 comma 2 first 0th index then second index why because in the question there was one more assumption written which was print the indices in increasing order if two indices add up to a given target the value to add those indices first print the smaller index then print the greater index that's why it is 0th index space second index why because 0th index is having value 2 second index is having value 5 2 plus 5 is equal to 7 it is equal to target we are printing or we are gay we are saying we are returning the array containing two values 0 and 2 so that's how what we have to solve in this problem. So what will happen if there is no target pair found in this question? It is not mentioned that there will be a pair with no target found but in a follow-up if it is coming in an interview, you can ask it you can clarify it with your underwear that what should I do if there is no such pair whose sum equal to target. So for now, we are again assuming that there will be always exactly one solution possible. It means there will always be a pair it will never be possible that there are multiple pairs and similarly, it will never be possible that there are zero pair or you can say no pair possible. So how we can figure out how we can find out the answers now coming up to the approach. Let's take some array. So I'm taking almost the similar kind of array or maybe a random array. Let's me let me just randomize the values. Let me take 2 then let me take actually 9 then let me take 8. 4 and 5 so this array is just shuffled array because array values can be anything this is 0th index 1st index 2nd index 3rd index 4th index I am taking example input we need to figure out the target 7 is there any pair with target 7 with some 7 and answer is yes 2 plus 5 but how will we figure out it we will say the most basic approach the brute force approach can be a nested loop why since we have to pick two elements one element can be picked by one loop another element can be picked by another loop two loops nested inside of one another that is let's say first element which I am picking is 2 can I pick 9 is a 2 plus 9 equal to 7 no can I pick 8 is 2 plus 8 equal to 7 no can I pick 4 is 2 plus 4 equal to 7 no can I pick 5 is 2 plus 5 equal to 7 yes so return 0 comma 4 that is the pair indices let's assume the target was not 7 let's assume the target was maybe 9 in that case what will you do I will say instead of taking the first index as zero index let's take some other index let's take first index as the first index as the first element in the pair second element in the pair can it be the first index itself can we take two indices having the two elements in the pair having the same index no we have to take a different index today start the loop from the zeroth index again actually no if I have already compared nums of zero plus nums of one no need to compare nums of one plus nums of zero it is one in the same pair so we can start actually with the directly second index is a nine plus eight equal to nine no is a nine plus four equal to nine no is a nine plus five equal to nine no then again similarly first index plus plus that is the outer loop variable plus plus and inner loop variable will actually start from two plus one third index is eight plus four equal to nine no is eight plus five equal to nine no and same goes with the first index will become plus plus second index will be the outer index plus one. 2 is a 4 plus 5 equal to 9 answer is yes so return the pair return the third index comma the fourth index first the smaller index then the bigger index what will be the time as you can clearly see one loop linear time another loop again linear time inverse case it will be 1 plus 2 plus 3 up till up till n overall total time so it will come out to be n into n plus 1 by 2 which you can say is n square time complexity there are two nested loops two loops one inside another so that is n square quadratic time what about space since we will not require any extra space we will have constant space solution only two pointers ptr1 or ptr2 are required but can we optimize it further can we do better than n square time complexity the answer is yes we can do what will be the optimized solution how will I come up with the optimized solution see if all the elements are in random order we need to figure out whether there is a pair which is equal to target we cannot do it better. better without either taking it in certain data structure or without taking it in certain order. We have to arrange all the elements in the particular order or we have to take some other data structure some extra data structure in order to solve it. So the solution which we are picking will be to use some ordering of the element and mainly there are two kinds of ordering which we can follow either the increasing order or the decreasing order but the question is why will the ordering of the elements matter why will the ordering if I make the elements in sorted order that is an increasing order why will it help me or how can it help me so if let's suppose I have sorted all the values that is 2 4 5 8 9 and the target which we are figuring out is 9 only let's do a try run for the 9 target itself how we can figure out the target if we are just having the first element at the first zeroth index the first possible index second index at the next index. You cannot optimize you have to figure out every pair and every pair means the outer loop will also run for all indices inner loop will also run for all indices but a slight change. What is that slight change? The first loop should run from left to right only that is the first pointer actually not first loop but first pointer should run from left to right only but what if the second pointer runs from right to left will it help me in any fashion will it help me in optimizing the time complexity if I have already sorted so if I have already sorted what is the time complexity to sort it is n log n but after sorting am I able to do it better than n square that is the main game so what is the sum of this pair it is 2 plus 9 2 plus 9 is 11 11 is more than 9 I have to figure out a pair with some 9 I am having a pair with some 11 the sum 11 is more than some 9 what we should what should be the aim the aim should be to reach the sum 9 in order to reach sum 9 I have to decrease the sum I have to make 11 go to 9 that means I have to subtract 2 from the sum how can I subtract the sum how can I reduce the sum of the pair can I or should I actually make 2 become 4 or you can say 2 become 5 or 2 become 8 no it will increase the sum 2 becoming 4 or 5 or 8 will make it 9 plus 4 9 plus 5 9 plus 8 what about making the 9 value reduce what about 2 plus 8 yes surely it will decrease 2 plus 5 it will decrease it will decrease even further than 9 but it is decreasing the main goal is you have to decrease the sum so what is the observation the observation is that if one pointer is at the leftmost index in a sorted array another pointer is at the rightmost index in the sorted array what we can do is we can figure out the sum of the leftmost and the rightmost element the sum is more than what we require so how we can reduce the sum we can reduce the sum by making the right point go to the previous element that is a smaller value element because it is sorted sorted means previous element will be lesser value now again ask 2 plus 8 2 plus 8 is 10 again we are having a greater sum we need only 9 we are coming to be 10 we require a lesser sum value so again we will do right pointer whatever pointer name we are giving it let's say we are giving it right and left so again we will say right pointer minus minus that is go to the previous value a smaller value now what will happen 2 plus 5 the sum will come out to be 7 okay what to do with 7 7 is smaller than 9 i want a sum 9 in order to make the sum 9 should i form a pair 5 comma 4 or 2 comma 4 obviously the better sum will be 5 comma 4 that is i have to discard 2 i have to increase the sum means i have to discard the smaller value and go to a bigger value then only the sum will increase so how can i discard the smaller value i can make the left pointer go to the right the next index that is left pointer will become plus plus so it is a simple divide and conquer strategy even if we do not know how divide and conquer it is good enough no problem it is a simple not exactly divide and conquer but you can say it is a two pointer strategy where what we are doing is we are figuring out the sum if the sum is greater than what we need decrease the sum by right minus minus if the sum is lesser than what we need increase the sum by making left plus plus so in these two cases right minus minus right minus minus in this case left plus plus so what is our sum right now sum right now is the array of left plus array of right nums of left plus nums of right it is four plus five and what is four plus five it is equal to target nine and if it is equal to target nine yes the target is found but there should be certain code certain logic when the target is not found when the pair with the target sum is not present so let's assume the target which we require was not 9 let's suppose it was 8 so in case of 8 since the sum is smaller what we it is actually greater greater than 8 what we will do we will try to reduce the sum I am taking another test case where the target is 8 so I will reduce the sum and in order to reduce the sum what I will do I will make the right pointer minus minus but as soon as I make right pointer minus minus both left and right becomes equal so as soon as the left pointer and right pointer becomes equal they come to the same index we can say stop now because we cannot take the same index or even if let's say there was the right pointer going to the previous index then only then also I can say that there is empty or we have considered all the pairs so as soon as the left and right pointer crosses each other then we can stop so that will be the termination condition what will be the overall time once first since we need sorting in most of the programming languages the most optimized approach to sort is using nlogin the enable sorting after doing the inbuilt sorting in increasing order we can apply this two-pointer logic which is using a pointer from left to right named as left pointer another pointer from right to left named as right pointer and applying a strategy where if the sum will be greater or lower we are deciding accordingly we should do left plus plus or right minus minus so it will be taking linear time only why almost you can say half of the elements first pointer will be traversing almost in average case half the elements n2 will be or right pointer will be traversing n by 2 plus n by 2 or even if left pointer traverses the entire array in that case right pointer will only travel zero elements so it will always come out to be linear in nature so overall time complexity will be n log n plus n overall will be n log n only because sorting is overpowering the two-pointer in terms of time complexity what about space since we again only require two-pointer the space complexity will again be constant no extra space required but we are able to the time at least so what we are going to do now is we are going to write the instruction manual we have decided this because the second milestone that is coming up to a approach so what is the instruction manual going to be our step is obviously to start of the array and in order to sort of the array we will be using the inbuilt function so sort array using inbuilt function and every language will have a inbuilt function to sort array in increasing order mostly in n log n time complexity then second step in the instruction manual will be that we have to initialize two pointers as discussed the left pointer and the right pointer so initialize left integer as 0 and right integer as what right integer as the array dot len minus 1 n minus 1 where I am assuming you can think easily that what is n and n is nums dot len now once the two pointers are initialized we will run the loop till when should we run the loop only till the array will have some two elements remaining at least two elements remaining. So when I can say that when the left will be smaller than right why because if left will be equal to right the same index cannot be same taken together that is we cannot have nums of i common nums of j with i equal to j or also we cannot take nums of i common nums of j where i is greater than j so we only have to run the loop that is run a while loop till what point till the left is smaller than right and if it is what you have to do we have to take the sum as what? Take the sum as the nums of left plus nums of right that is the value at the left pointer plus value at the right pointer. Once it is taken there are three scenarios it is equal to target it is smaller than target it is greater than target. So if sum is equal to target is equal to target what do we have to do? We have to return the pair in the form of indices in the array. return an array containing left and right that is an array of two integers having left and right indices otherwise if sum is not equal to target then maybe sum is greater than target if sum is greater than target we have to decrease the sum in order to decrease the sum we have to make the right pointer minus minus that is right pointer should become one to the left make it go to the right left side actually and if the sum is obviously not greater than target not equal to target then it will be less than target and if it is less than target what should we do increase the sum how we can increase the sum by making left pointer plus plus that is go towards the right side make the sum increase because it is array as sorted and once this entire loop is done in some languages it will ask you to return something so in order to make this code or make this instruction manual language agnostic we are returning something we can return null mostly languages supports null so what we are doing is in order to return something otherwise languages like java will show me error that you are not returning anything after the loop you are your code is unreachable some kind of error will be shown so that's why we are returning null although this line will never hit why because in the question it was mentioned that exactly there will be one solution so at some particular time this if condition will get hit it will never happen that it is not getting it so this is the entire instruction manual where we will be coding the problem in java language and we will also discuss about some corner test cases first in order to apply two-pointer logic we will require the array to be in increasing order so what is the inbuilt function to sort in java it is actually arrays dot sort and inside the parentheses i will pass the array to be sorted that is nums once the array is sorted now i can apply the two pointers that is left pointer initially zero right pointer initially nums dot line minus one that is n minus one once the two pointers are initialized run a loop run a logic a single loop only until the point left is smaller than right because as soon as the left becomes equal to right or more than right then there are no more pair remaining we have to take the sum as what as nums of left plus nums of right that is the current left pointer index plus the current right pointer index value there are three scenarios as discussed if the sum will be equal to target if the sum will be greater than target if the sum will be smaller than target so if sum is greater than target and finally the last else will be the smaller than target this will be smaller let's add else here also even if you do not want to add you can still just omit it what we have to do if the sum is found if the sum is found return an array containing two values having left and right so in one line how you can return an array having two values left and right return a new array that is new keyword integer array specifically square bracket means array but no need to specify the size to and then give the values as area of 0 area of 1 you can directly write in the curly brackets that I need to pass two values that are left and right so it will automatically do what it will automatically create a area of 2 size having values left index and right index and return it so this is the short syntax if the sum is not equal to target then it might be greater than target and if it is greater than target as written in the instruction manual we have to decrease the sum by making right pointer minus minus and otherwise if it is equal not equal actually and not greater then only point remaining is increasing the sum by making left plus plus so this is the entire code if I will run this code before writing return null let's see the first error that what kind of error will we get if we are not returning null in the last in particular to java language so it is taking some time to run so it is saying missing return statement or maybe you can have certain you can say that your code is not and your code is not reachable or your code is not returning anything although the return type is something so far now we are returning null because we are sure that this line will never hit so let's see if the code is getting with the same output as a sample inputs corresponding output or not yes what will happen if I am saying I have not sorted the array let's see what is output is output same as what we require if I have by mistake missed the sorting part so if I have by mistake missed the sorting part till for the sample input actually it is giving me the correct output but let's try it for the test case one more test case which is 5 2 4 5 9 8 and let's take the target as 7 maybe in this case it might give me some other output the output which should be that is expected output is 0 comma 2 let's see if it is giving me 0 comma 2 or not it is taking some time to run and it is actually giving 0 comma 2 but there might be some other test cases where it will give wrong answer maybe let's take some 9 what will happen for some 9 let's see it might give me wrong answer it might give me correct also let's see it is taking some time to run it is taking 1, 2 actually it is still giving me correct but what about 29845 if the input array is unsorted and it is 29845 298 then let's say 45 what about now should it give me the correct answer or not or will it give me the correct answer or not without sorting that is what we are trying to see and yes now it is giving me a null pointer exception so altogether it is not running at all it is going to some certain index which does not exist so sorting is required in order to apply to pointer that was the main thing and also one more important point is that since we have sorted we will be taking n log n time complexity since we are applying to pointer we will be taking linear time but overall dominant time will be n log n What about space? Since we are not taking any extra space, only two pointers left and right, it is constant space solution. And in the question, according to the assumption, it was specifically mentioned that we do not have to take the same index twice. That's why we are writing left smaller than right. If we are allowed to take same index twice, we can just run the loop till left less than equal to right. One follow up before ending this video, which I want you to solve will be, can you try to solve it in even lesser time complexity, that is, in maybe linear time complexity. Currently, we are taking n log n. If yes, will you require any extra data structure to do so? And if yes, which data structure will you use? So that will be a follow up question which you have to explore on yourself. Till then, bye bye, take care."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome to this video where we are going to discuss the problem Diagonal Sum 2. So we will be discussing this problem in two parts. We will discuss about milestone 1, 2 and 3 where we will understand the problem treatment where we will come up with the approach in order to solve this and then we will also write the instruction manual that is the pseudocode and once we are done with it in the next part we will be discussing milestone 4 and 5 where we will write the code using the instruction manual. So let's just directly jump on to the first part which is the problem statement. Given a square matrix MAT return the sum of the diagonal elements sum of the all the elements along the diagonal and matrix is given as you can see is a square matrix that is the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix will be equal. And include the sum of all elements on the diagonal. the primary diagonal and all elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary diagonal but now the point is what is the primary diagonal what is the secondary diagonal so for that there is a sample input given input format will be n representing the size of matrix n cross n that is the number of rows number of columns both will be n and output will should be the single integer sum representing sum of all elements on both the diagonals primary as well as secondary if there is three rows three columns for this matrix having values 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 what will be the primary diagonal the primary diagonal will be the values the diagonal with having values 1 5 & 9 and what will be the secondary diagonal the secondary diagonal will be having values 2 5 & 7 so this is primary diagonal this is secondary diagonal and in the problem description it was mentioned in the secondary diagonal don't take the elements that are part of primary. that is if let's say some element 5 is a part of primary diagonal as well as secondary diagonal I do not have to take it twice I have to only take it once so what will be the output the output will be 1 plus 5 plus 9 plus 2 plus 7 actually not 2 plus 7 but 3 plus 7 and do not include 5 again so overall the sum will be 1 plus 5 plus 9 plus 3 plus 7 which is 25 and it is mentioned in the note that element matrix of 1 comma 1 that is having value 5 is counted only once do not take it twice because it is present twice in the diagonal no if it is present in both the diagonals still take it once only so that corner case we have to keep in mind we have to figure out that what all types of matrix will have this kind of corner case but before that actually let's try to have some more discusses to understand the problem statement more clearly so constraints as you can see is both the rows and columns will be equal because it is a square matrix which will be from 1 to 100 number of squares the number of rows number of columns in the square matrix will be from 1 to 100 at least 1 row 1 column maximum 100 rows 100 columns and all the values will also be from 1 to 100 so the point is how we can actually solve this first let's take the same test case let's try to figure out the indices which are getting as a part of any of the diagonals what all indices are part of the primary diagonal what all indices are part of the secondary diagonal so if I will mark the primary diagonal what are the indices can I say this element is present at 0 comma 0 index 0 throw 0 column this element is present at the first row first column this element is present at the second row second column but what about the secondary diagonal if I will mark the secondary diagonal this all values which I am marking in yellow are part of secondary diagonal what are the indices this is nothing but 0 index as row second index as column this is again first index comma first index that is 1 comma 1 and this is two comma zero so if I am first of all figuring out what is the property for rows I can clearly see for the primary diagonal the row is getting less plus only that is from zero throw to first row to second row throw is getting plus plus in fact for the secondary diagonal also zero throw first row second row row will become plus plus but how about the columns for the primary diagonal the columns are also becoming plus plus going from 0 to 1 to 2 actually both row and column are same only if row is 0 column is also 0 row is 1 column is also 1 row is 2 column is equal to 2 so we do not need to run a nested loop for both rows and columns we can run a single loop where both row and column will become plus plus row will also become 0 to 1 column will also become 0 to 1 row will also become 1 to 2 column will also become 1 to 2 so when it comes to the primary diagonal the clear property is the primary diagonal is let's say I comma i where the row as well as column is same but when it comes to the secondary diagonal that is the yellow diagonal which i have marked we can see it is starting from the top right corner top right corner means 0th row only but right corner that is the last column so it is starting from if i am saying 0 then the column will be n minus 1 that is the last column if the row will be 1 what will be the column the column will be actually let me mark it in maybe yellow only so if this is 0 comma 2 which is 0 comma n minus 1 this is 1 comma n minus 2 like we are doing column minus minus as this time from second column going to first column and then again we will be basically doing column minus minus this will be n minus 3 or you can say 3 minus 3 which is 0 so for the secondary diagonal row plus plus but column minus minus starting from 0 comma n minus 1 for primary diagonal row will also become plus plus column will also become plus plus starting from both as a zero and we have to run a single loop for the primary diagonal a single loop for the secondary diagonal the only point is don't take this element twice so when we are running the loop for secondary diagonal if the element is also a part of primary diagonal how we can check whether it is part of primary diagonal if row will be equal to column then it is a primary diagonal element 0 0 1 1 2 2 all elements apart from this in the secondary diagonal are not having row equal to column so whichever element will have row equal to column in the secondary diagonal it is also a part of primary so don't include it in the secondary so finally what we will say 1 for the primary diagonal 1 plus 5 plus 9 but for the secondary diagonal 3 is it also part of primary no row is not equal to column so take 3 in the sum is 5 also part of primary is it already taken yes row is equal to column so do not take it twice 7 is it part of primary diagonal also no row is not equal to column so take it because it is not taken yet so answer will be whatever 25 or 25 I guess yes so this will be the output but what will happen for a matrix where there are even a number of rows this was a case where n was 3 what will happen for 4 rows 4 columns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and then finally the last row will be 13 14 15 16 let's assume this is the matrix then the primary diagonal this will be the primary diagonal how will it look like starting from top left to bottom right and the secondary diagonal will be starting from top right going to bottom left is there any element which is occurring in both the diagonals this time actually no primary diagonal is having 1 6 11 16 secondary diagonal is having 4 7 10 13 this time for 4 rows 4 columns there is no element which is occurring on both the diagonals because intersection is in between the elements so it might happen that there is no repeating element So we have to not discard the repeating element if it is not there, but it might happen there is a repeating element. We have to discard it. So our algorithm should actually work for both kinds of test cases. So we have already discussed the approach that is do the primary diagonal, calculate the sum separately, calculate for the secondary diagonal separately. So we can do what we can actually start writing the instruction manual. So for the diagonal sum, what we are saying, first of all, get the sum of primary diagonal from a function. We will try to write different methods, different functions for each concept or each diagonal. So get sum of primary diagonal by calling, by getting answer from by calling, let's say primary sum, we are saying a function is primary sum and passing the matrix in it because any function will require the matrix for which it can calculate the sum. And similarly, get the sum of secondary diagonal by calling the secondary sum. let's say the function name is secondary sum secondary sum this was primary sum so we will be creating these two prototype these two function definitions but whatever the sum of primary sum will be let's say this is we are going to do the sum of both the primary and secondary so for that we can actually maintain a answer variable so initialize or maybe set integer answer as a zero and then what do the sum of the primary diagonal in the answer add answer add the sum in the answer add sum in the answer and same goes for the secondary diagonal also add sum in the answer and finally we can return the answer because that is what we need so return the answer but the point is how we can make both these diagonals how we can calculate the sum of these diagonals for them I am creating two functions so static int if I am writing in Java although you can write the prototype in your language according to your needs I am just writing the prototype for now this function will give me the primary diagonal sum. Similarly, there will be one more function which will give me the secondary diagonal sum and these two functions together will give me the answer. So for primary diagonal we are saying let's initialize the answer again because we have to take the sum of all values as zero but for primary diagonal as discussed the indices will go from 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 and so on top left to bottom right. So let's initialize let's set row the initial row as 0 as well as column as 0 because starting from 0 comma 0 top right cell top left cell actually the top left cell is where from we will start from and we will go to the bottom right by doing row plus plus as well as column plus plus till which point till we can say we are going out of the matrix that is till the row becomes n zeroth row first row second row if row becomes third third row does not exist for a matrix having three rows three columns so as soon as the row becomes n zeroth row we are done. becomes equal to n we have to stop so run a for loop or a while loop anything you can have a condition with condition what with the condition row should be less than n where n is the number of rows so let's initialize let's set n as the number of rows as the number of rows in matrix so you can use inbuilt functions in different languages to actually get the number of rows or you can use some properties from a given matrix but once we have figured out the number of rows once we have initialized the answer we have initialized row and column as 0 we will be running the loop as discussed till row is less than n that is till the row is within the matrix we will add the current value in the target add the matrix value add the row comma column in the answer and once we are able to add it we will do what for the primary diagonal row will increment as well as will increment so row plus plus and column plus plus both will become plus plus only and once this loop is ending we can just return the answer that is what you have to do for primary diagonal no need to check whether for now the limit is repeating or not because repeating should be discarded the repeating element should be discarded in the secondary sum in the secondary diagonal if a element is in a secondary diagonal is also a part of time the diagonal do not take it so let's copy all of these we will do the changes accordingly we will again have the number of rows as n we will again initialize the answer as 0 but this time row will be initially 0 starting from the top right corner column will not be 0 column will be the last column column as n minus 1 and the value of condition will be same we will be going till the matrix we are within the matrix that is row is within n less than n row 0 row 1 row 2 because both the diagonals are going from top to down only but at the matrix present at row comma column only if the element is not repeating if a row is the same as column is equal to column don't take it if row is equal to column just continue then continue continue means to not apply these two lines do not run these two lines but row as we discussed will go top to bottom but column will be going from right to left that is column will become minus minus so these few changes were there for the second reason so we have now actually completed the instruction manual we will actually write the code of the problem diagonal sum 2 in different programming languages and now we will be using java language as a medium to write the code so first of all we will be saying just calculate the sum from two different diagonals so let's try to have a answer variable which will give me the answer which will help me to return the sum of both the diagonals we are saying first make a call to the primary diagonal sum that is by calling the function primary sum and passing the matrix in it so we will be saying let's have the sum is equals to what is equals to primary sum and we will be passing the matrix whatever sum is let's first actually do this much code and print the sum to confirm whether we are getting the correct sum or not and after printing sum what we can do is we can for now return something return 0 from the function because there is a function with return type similarly here also we will return 0 for now we are not implementing secondary sum let's first try to implement the primary sum function where we are setting n as what as the number of rows in the matrix or number of columns both are same but how to get number of rows in Java we can say and n is equals to MAT dot length dot length is the property or you can say length is the property which we can access to get the number of rows similarly answer will also be set initially to 0 because sum will be taken starting from 0 only and for the top left to bottom right diagonal for the primary diagonal row as well as column will start from 0 once we have initialized all the required variables now is the time to run a loop over the diagonal that is run a while loop till the point we are within the matrix till the point row is less than n because as soon as we will go out of the matrix we have to stop we can't say that just take the element every time just add the current element in the answer so answer plus equals to the matrix of row comma column matrix of square bracket row comma square bracket column and since we are going from top left top left to bottom right 0 0 1 1 2 2 row as well as column is becoming incremented by 1 so row plus plus as well as column plus plus so for now let's just return the answer and check whether the primary sum diagonal that is the top left to bottom right diagonal is working fine or not let's see if it is giving me the required sum for this particular matrix this is if this is the input output check be 1 plus 5 6 6 plus 9 as 14 6 plus 9 as 15 actually not 14 but 15 so what we are getting as output 15 is output obviously the final output is 0 because we are returning 0 in the last that is what also getting printed but primary sum is working absolutely fine so we can do what we can add in the answer so just add the current sum in the answer so we can actually write it in the one single line only instead of writing first take the sum and then add that sum we can just directly say that whatever the primary sum will be done me I will add in the answer variable answer plus equal to primary sum let's do it for the secondary diagonal also so for secondary diagonal we will be making a function called the way we made it for the first diagonal so let's say int sum is equal to secondary sum and by passing the matrix let's again just do the system to confirm whether the output we are getting is correct or not finally this time we should let's say we are returning answer although we have not completed the code because we should add this some variable in the answer also anyways we will again say int n is equals to MAT dot length that is the number of rows for the secondary diagonal also again answer will initialize from 0 the sum initialize from 0 we will take the row as well as column as 0 and n minus 1 respectively initially because we are starting from top right corner the top row last column 0th row n minus 1th column and this time the loop will be same because we are going from top to down only row till it is less than n we will run the loop but few changes will be there that is we will add the value in the answer add the matrix of row comma column in the answer row will still become plus plus but column will become minus minus because we are going from right to left last column till the first column top right corner till the bottom right now so if I will not add this if condition let's see what is happening let's just return the answer and see the answer if I am not discarding the element which is present in both the diagonals what will be the answer let's see we're taking some time to run and we are getting wrong output obviously but the output we are getting is 15 that is the second diagonal the secondary diagonal 3 plus 5 plus 7 is giving me actually 15 but this diagonal is also 15 this diagonal is also 15 I should not give the output as 15 plus 15 which is 30 I will have to take 15 plus only 10 the 5 element is present in both the diagonals do not take it twice so that's why we are adding a condition in the secondary case that is if row is the same as column it means the element is in the primary diagonal also then do not take it continue just do not take it we have to continue and otherwise we can say we have to basically write the answer plus is equal to matrix of row gamma column and actually before writing continue what we have to do is we have to do the row plus plus and column minus minus because if we will simply continue this loop will go into an infinite loop so what we can do is we can just have if row is not equal to column then do the addition otherwise don't do the addition otherwise don't add the answer so we can say like this if row is not equal to column then only add the answer so we have slightly change the logic so that the row plus plus and column minus minus happens even if row is equal to column otherwise it will go into infinite loop let's just run the code and see if it is working fine or not it is going to take some time to run and this time it is actually giving me 10 that is the secondary diagonal is excluding the element which was also present in primary diagonal 5 so now we can add the sum in the answer by directly just saying answer plus is equal to secondary sum the same way which we did for primary and finally done the answer so if I will run the code it should give me accepted also this time because now we have not printed them separately but printed them on one attempt only so let's just submit it and hopefully it should work for all the test cases let's see it is taking some time and let's see if it is going accepted or not all the 15 test cases the corner game everything is going perfect"

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video, we will be discussing the algorithm known as bubble sort problem is given a unsorted array of integer that is there are some elements in the input array which are ordered in random order. What do you have to do is you have to sort them in ascending order and for now you can assume that there might be duplicates present, there might be no duplicates present, there might be that input elements having any value, it might be negative, it might be zero, it might be positive. But just for the dry run, we will be taking a simple test case. So we can have after the array to be sorted, the output will be in increasing order that is ascending order sorting is what we require. It should look like 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Now the point is how will you solve this problem using bubble sort technique. What will bubble sort say or what is the emphasis behind bubble sort? It is nothing but we will compare the adjacent elements one by one and if required we will do the swapping in order to make the array sorted. That is in order to make the array come in ascending order or increasing order. If any pair of adjacent elements we will see are opposite to what they want to be then we will swap them. Swap them means interchange their positions or interchange the values at those corresponding indices. Let's take the example of 0 index comma 1 index these are adjacent indices. After array becoming sorted do we require 50 before 30 in ascending order? No, we will say 50 is greater than 30 it means 50 should come after 30. What do you mean by that is we will do the swapping in between 50 and 30 so that we are Approaching towards a sorted array in increasing order. However, when you compare in between 30 and 40, what will you say? Comparing between these two elements, you will not really do a swap. The reason being 30 is smaller than 40 only, and it should remain smaller in the left-hand side. That is, we should not swap these elements. Sometimes they will be doing swapping. Sometimes they will not do swap, but we can't just only compare all the adjacent elements only once. We won't have a single pass and say the array will get sorted. We will require multiple passes in order to do it. So let's start the algorithm by the first pass. And what do you mean by first pass? We are going to each pair which are having adjacent indices and comparing whether we should have the swap or not, whether we should interchange the positions or not. So what are the adjacent positions which are available? Either it might be that you are comparing in between 50 and 30, that is the first possible pair. have 30 here, we will say since 50 is greater than 30 after array being sorted, 50 should come in the right hand side. It means do the swap between them, make this value 30, make this value 50 and remaining array obviously will remain same. The remaining array will have 40, 20, 10. This is only the first pass going on. We will have all the pairs that is now next pair will get compared, which is actually the first index going to get compared with second index value. Obviously we are bothered about the adjacent indices and swaps between them because bubble sort relies on that logic. This time what we will do is we will compare first index with second index. That is the values which will get compared is 50 versus 40 because now we have 50 here after the swapping is done. This is 30, this is 20, this is 10. What we will say is 50 is also greater than 40. It again means that 50 should come after 40 and 50 should come after 40. We will do. the swap between the first index and the second index value I hope everyone already knows how to do swaps between two elements of an array if not then we will also discuss that logic during the dry run of the instruction manual or during the writing of the pseudocode. So we will swap these elements because we want to sort the array in ascending order but the first path is still not complete there are still more pairs of adjacent elements so 30 is present here 40 is present here 50 is here 20 is here 10 is here now is the point we are comparing 50 with 20 that is the second index with the third index so if you will compare these two indices what will you say is again 50 is greater than 20 again we should swap these elements and if we will do the swap this will become 20 this will become 50 there is one more pair of adjacent elements which is yet to be compared which is the third index with the fourth one first pair was 0,1 next pair was 1,2 next pair is 2,3 3. Now the final pair, which we are about to compare is third index with the fourth index. Let me just quickly write the array. This is 30, 40, 20, 50, 10 at this moment. And when you will compare the values present at 3 and 4, that is values 50 and 10. Again, the same thing is what you are about to say, that is, we need swapping because 50 is more than 10. 50 should come in the right side of 10 after sorting the array. So make this value 10, make this value 50. After doing the single pass, is the array sorted? As I said, it is not necessary. It might be, but it might not be. And highly likely it is not going to be sorted because you can see it is not sorted. It is having 30, then 40, then it is a dip having value 20. Then it is again a dip having value 10. Then it is having value 50. So there can be any order of values present. What we necessarily need to do is have multiple passes. But there is one very important observation which we can make out of the first pass. pass and what is the important information although the entire array is not sorted but surely one of the value is at the sorted position after array getting sorted what will it look like it will look like 10 20 30 40 50 out of these five values if you will just compare it with the sorted array you will see that the heaviest element biggest value element maximum element after doing the first pass is actually at its correct position because it should be at the correct position this is how we are doing the swappings or this is how we are doing the comparisons what we were doing was comparing 50 with 30 going it making it to the right side because it was heavier swapping it with 40 because it was more than 40 swapping it with 20 because it was more than 20 swapping it with 10 because it was more than 20 so we are essentially making the heaviest element go to the right most side so 50 at the first pass after the completion of the first pass pass is already sorted. That is the last index of the array. If array was a 5 size, the fourth index of the array is already sorted. So in the next pass, do we really need to compare 4 pairs? Do we really need to compare this time 30 with 40, 40 with 20, 20 with 10 and also 10 with 50? The answer is no. We don't require 4 comparisons in the next pass. In next pass, we don't need to compare with 50 because 50 is already sorted. 50 will not change its position because it is the maximum element and it will be at the rightmost position. So that is the important logic what we have to just ensure that next pass we will not compare with 50. Even if you compare, the time complexity will not change in big O notation, worst case notation, but still it will be better if you are following the exact same strategy which is bubble sort. So we will say in the next pass, let's first copy the array which is nothing but this time 30, 40, 20. 50 10 and then finally 50 this is the array but this time what we will do is we will only do 3 pairs of comparisons that is 0 with 1 1 with a 2 and then 2 with 3 no need to compare with the last index because it is already sorted first if we compare 30 with 40 will they do the swap between them will be swap let me just write it a little towards the top there's a 0 1 2 3 4 now we are doing the first pass actually the second pass this was the first pass what we will say is 30 is in the left hand side 40 is in the right hand side 30 is smaller than 40 it should remain as it is in the output order also so don't swap we will compare but we are not swapping but since we are comparing it is still a iteration getting passed we still require some loop in order to do that so 30 40 20 10 50 the array is remaining same but this time if you compare 40 with 20 we will say 40 is greater than 20 yes we require a swap this value will be 20 this value will become 40 if you write the next array it is 30, 20, 40, 10, 50 and now if you will compare 40 with 10 again you will say require a swap heavier value on the left hand side should not be there smaller value on left hand side should be there so make it 10 make it 40 and after the second pass having only three comparisons we can say 50 was already sorted at the last index but now after the second pass the second heaviest element is also sorted 40 is at the second last index because it is the second largest element that is at third index so in the next pass we can't say that array sorted completely but at least since two elements are sorted now next pass will be only among these three elements the comparisons will be only among these three that is there will be only two pairs of adjacents which we are going to compare in the pass number three so what we are going to do this time is let me first copy this array This is 30, 20, 10, 40, 50. Just the previous array we are using it. It is not copying. It is just I am doing the dry run and while doing the dry run, I want it to be as clean as possible. So this is 0th index, 1st index, 2nd index, 3rd index, 4th index, where 0 till 2 is only unsorted, 3 and 4 is for sure sorted. So since only two pairs are required, let me just draw those two pairs between 0, 1 and 1, 2. First, you will compare the 0 index with the 1st index. What you will see is 30 getting compared with 20. We require swaps. This should become 20. This should become 30 because smaller element should be on the left-hand side. If you will do that swap. Now, when you will be comparing 1st index with the 2nd index, you again will say 30 is also smaller than actually 10 is also smaller than 30 or 30 is greater than 10. Again, do a swap and again doing a swap. What will the array look like now is 20, 10, 30, 40, 50. After the third pass. How many elements are sorted after first pass one heaviest element was sorted after second pass two heaviest elements were sorted after the third pass three heaviest elements will be sorted that is 30 40 50 last index second last index third last index will be having correct elements which will be there in sorted array as well but is the array sorting done no we still we have two elements which are not in the sorted order not in ascending order so at least we can say that we require how many more comparisons since there are two elements how many comparisons will we do is one comparison in between them that is in between zero and one so now the last pass will actually only take a single comparison which we will say is the pass number four so let me just show the pass number four here itself what we will do this time is in this array if you will compare let me just actually copy the array not use the same array for that let me make it a little bit smaller and let's copy the array array. This is 20, 10, 30, 40, 50. We can say we will compare zero index with the first index. And if you will compare them, you will say require sorting or actually not sorting, but swapping is required. This will become 10. This will become 20. Let me just write it in blue. As soon as you do this fourth pass, you can for sure say one element was sorted after pass one, two elements were sorted after pass two, three elements are sorted after pass three. Are there only four elements which are sorted after pass four? Yes, there are for sure four elements, but if there is an area of five size out of which four elements are sorted, automatically the fifth element is sorted. There is no other comparisons which we can make for 10. 10 is automatically at the correct position. So we don't really require the fifth pass for an area of five size. We only require four passes. That is for an area of n size, we will only be requiring n minus one passes for the bubble sort. Each pass how much time are we taking in worst case it might be n minus 1 comparison that are 4 comparisons or 3 comparisons or 2 comparisons or 1 comparison in worst case it will be n comparisons or n minus 1 or even if you just want to calculate the total number of iterations it will be 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 that is 1 plus 2 plus 3 up till up till n minus 1 so overall time complexity will be how much it will be sum of first n minus 1 natural numbers and if you will just calculate it it will come out to be n minus 1 times n by 2 but in big O notation you can simply say it is quadratic that is n square in big O notation you don't take the smaller powers of n so just by looking the time complexity you can assume what will be the code looking like it will be most probably a nested loop one loop for each pass because there are multiple passes and inner loop for comparisons between adjacents in that pass. which will start from 0 with 1, 1 with 2, 2 with 3, 3 with 4. If let's say this variable is i this variable will be i plus 1 or if let's say this is inner variable inner loop variable let's name it j and let's the pass variable be named as i outer loop let's name it as i inner loop we will name it as j that we will do during the try run of the instruction manual but the point is this is about time what do you think is the space complexity used by bubble sort we can say if the input array is of integers we can just directly change the input array itself there is no need to create a new array and if there is no need to create a new array space complexities for sure constant extra space is required or constant output space is required because what we are about to return the array which we are about to return will be same as the input array no new arrays used so such kind of solutions which require constant extra space are known as in place solutions that is we can do the swappings do the comparisons in the same input array itself no need to copy the elements no need to create new data structures so time will be quadratic space will be constant and the time will actually be quadratic only in worst case or average case if you want to optimize the best case you can but that is actually a follow-up you can just look on your own how to optimize in best case what will be best case hint is if add is already sorted an input how will you use that already sorted array to just maybe sort in linear time not n square time because if I already sorted you don't have to actually do any swappings but we are not doing that kind of optimization for now we can assume that we have to code in worst case only or we have to just only take care of worst case time complexity for that let's write the instruction manual so I will be writing instruction manual in the sort array function which will be taking the input array and which is expecting a output array to be returned. Since we don't have to create a new array we can directly start with the loops there will be two loops required run a for loop for passes over let's say index over index i from 0 or 1 if you are starting from 1 till which index the last index will be or the last pass number will be 4 which is n-1 there are total n-1 passes so start the i loop that is pass loop from 1 to n-1 inside each pass what we are going to do is we are going to run another loop run a for loop for comparisons for comparisons over indices starting from 0 because the indexes always start from 0 only we will compare 0 with 1, 1 with 2, 2 with 3 and last comparison will be with 3 and 4 so If let's say we are using this variable as I this will be I plus one this is I this is I plus one this is I this is I plus one this is I this is I plus one if pass variable actually this is not I this will be J because I variable we have already used for pass if I was one till when is the J running till you can say it is going till three if I is one J is going till three that is zero comma one J comma J plus one one comma two two comma three and finally three comma four so final J variable is three so I is one last J variable will be three we have to find what will be the last J variable till when we should run if I is two that is pass is two what is the last J variable it is only second index second index getting a bit with third index I to J is also two if I is three that is pass is three what is the last J index it is nothing but the first index and finally for the last pass i as a 4 what is the j the j is actually last j is only 0 so how you can calculate j using i because as you can see as i is changing as the pass is changing the last comparison is also reducing it is starting from 3 then 2 then 1 then 0 so what is 3 it is actually n minus 1 minus 1 that is from last index take the previous one n minus 1 is the fourth index take minus 1 from it what is 2 this is n minus 1 minus 2 from last index go to indices previous to that what is 1 it is n minus 1 minus 3 that is from 4 subtract 3 you will get to 1 and what is 0 it is n minus 1 minus 4 so what is minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 minus 4 it is actually minus i itself minus pass is itself so the last j variable will be n minus 1 minus i n minus 1 minus i n minus 1 minus i n minus 1 minus i what we are going to say is for the inner loop the j variable not i will start from 0 but go till n minus 1 minus i and inside that what we have to do is we have to compare if the value if value at the array of j is more than array of j plus 1 it means the left value is greater than right value we have to do swapping for ascending order and if we have to do swapping we will most likely swap values at array of j with array of j plus 1 I am not writing how will you swap them but let's discuss how we can actually do it let's say the i and j or actually not i and j but j and j plus 1 were 0 and 1 if j is 0 j plus 1 will be 1 let's say the values present here is 100 let's say the value present here is 50 we have to swap them what we will do is in order to swap two elements we have to take a third element or the third variable which is j plus 1 we have to swap j plus 1 also do it without third variable but easier one will be using third variable. Let's say a temporary variable where you can store either array of j or you can store array of j plus one it is up to you. Let's say we are storing array of j in the temporary variable now since you have stored 100 in temporary variable you can go ahead and update it with the new value which should be 50 that is array of j should get updated as array of j plus one and then you can update this array of j plus one as 100 but where is 100 here 100 is not now at array of j it is updated with 50 array of j plus one should be updated with temporary variable array of j plus one should be updated with temporary variable where what was temporary variable it was the same copied value from array of j itself so these are the three steps in order to swap two elements present at the j and the j plus 1th index so i'm not writing those logics here but it is self-explanatory that you have to use a temporary variable a third variable in order to swap two elements present at the j to swap two values. After this entire logic is done, you have to return the array. So we will return the same input array, return the same input array, which is ARR in this case, no need to create a new array, because it is an in place solution. And that was all about your pseudocode or the instruction manual for the problem bubble sort, we will be writing the code in Java programming language, we were having multiple passes in each path, we were doing some comparisons. Outer loop will be for passes for which I am using a variable named as i starting from some value, going till some value. But when it comes to the inner loop, it is going to be used for the comparison. And eventually the swaps which we are naming as j starting from some value going till some value. And what we are doing inside the inner loop is we are comparing first without swapping first compare that is the left element. that is at the jth index greater than the right element that is present at the j plus 1th index does the next index if it is we have to swap these values and how to swap these values we already discussed in the approach video we have to take a third variable which is temporary so let's say temporary storing array of j now you can update array of j with the other value that is array of j plus 1 and you can make the array of j plus 1 get updated with array of j but where is array of j stored now it's stored at temp so you will say we have to update it with temporary so these are the three steps in order to swap two elements present in array but only thing which is remaining is the question mark what is the question marks going to be how are passes or how many passes are we having they are from first pass till n minus 1th pass because of array of five size we only require four passes so let's start with one and let's go till less than n because less than n will eventually mean less than equal to n minus 1 But when it comes to comparisons, we will always start comparison in between 0 and 1 that is 0 and 0 plus 1 that is j will start from 0. What is the last index of j? It will be based on the i value on the pass number. If pass will be first pass, the last j index will be n minus 2. If j, if the second pass is there, i is 2, the j variable will go till n minus 3 and so on. So the last j variable will be less than n minus i, or you can say less than equal to n minus i minus 1, both will work. This is the code for the bubble sort in Java. It will most likely be same in other languages too. But since we have to return the output, output is same as input array, there is no new array which we are creating. We can just return here, no need to create a new array for return type. Let's just run this code and confirm whether it is going to work for all the test cases or not. So for that, I am opening. a terminal let me actually open the terminal for this and how I can find terminal let's see it should come from bottom so first I will compile the code by using the compiler of java and this is actually I am coding in vs code it is a online vs code inside github so first we have to compile a java code by using javac then the file name or the class name dot java that is sorting algorithm dot java and then you can in the same line itself just run that code by using and and operator that is do two operations first operation is compilation second operation is execution which will be done by the jvm where you can give the command as java this time only sorting algorithm only the name no need to give the extension as dot java if you will hit enter what it is waiting for is actually there are some errors which we have to resolve then only we will give some input so the error is n will variable is not declared. What is n? n is the array size. So you can use n as array.length in java. You can get it from array.length itself. You can use array.length in java. Or you can also pass n variable in the function sort array. It is up to you. But most likely after doing these changes, if we will run, hopefully it should work. So right now as you can see, it is not showing any error but it is waiting for your input. So let's give the same input. First input will be the size of the array which is let's say 5. Now it is waiting for the elements. Elements are 50, 30, 40, 20, 10. Let's give the same array. 50, 30, 40, 20, 10. After sorted after, as soon as I hit enter, it should give me the output as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Let's see. And we can see the output as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Because the input output logic will most likely be given to you already. In interviews also you don't have to write this logic. Usually you only have to write the algorithm which is this much only. Having said that. What is the time complexity and what is the space complexity of this code? Since we are running two loops which are nested inside one another, both in worst case might run for n-1 times. So it will be overall in big O notation order of n square that is quadratic time complexity. However, as I told in the approach, just take a follow up in order to write this code or add some logic to make the best time complexity to be linear. That is add some logic to check whether an array is already sorted or not after each pass. But currently average and the worst case time complexity is quadratic n square. What about space? Since we are just updating the input array itself, there is no extra data structure which we are creating to solve this problem. So it is constant extra space or you can say it is an in-place solution. With that we are done with the bubble sort, the code of it. We will meet in a new video with a new problem. Till then bye-bye.

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back. In this particular video, we will be discussing the problem binary tree. The problem is given a binary tree, we have to return the in-order traversal of it. What is the in-order for this particular traversal for this particular tree traversal? It will be the 4 node, then 2, then 5, then 1 and then 3. What is the in-order traversal according to the question? It is left subtree, then root node, then right subtree. And this order should be holding true for all the nodes, not just for the root node, but all the nodes. So input format, we do not have to take care. Even if you want to read it, you can. That is, there will be some test cases given. Not only one tree will be there, but multiple trees will be there. Every tree will be given you as a query or as a test case. In each test case, you will be having n number of nodes in the tree and n number of nodes will be representing a binary tree. The format is. not what you want to just understand why because we only already have the root node of the tree given to us as a parameter we do not have to change it and also the output is not what we want to print the tree we only want to return the tree in in order to our cell using a list or you can say using a array now in the constraints what is given the maximum number of test cases will be 10 is for 3 the maximum number of nodes in single binary tree will be 10 is for 4 and the nodes in the tree will be at least 0 or at max 10 is for 9 the values in that 3 nodes and it is guaranteed that total number of nodes some of all of them across all the test cases will be less than 5 into 10 is part 6 so how we can actually solve any tree traversal in in order using recursion so for that what we will be doing is we will be copying the tree which we have used previously for pre-ordered reversal if you have not watched pre-order you can first watch that or you can watch this video directly because there is very less linking or you can say very familiar code but again we will reiterate the code or reiterate the approach so what we need in in order in in order we will be starting from root node only that is initially the root node will be passed but this function should be a recursive function it means we will be making recursive calls from a bigger problem to a smaller problem from a problem containing root we will be containing we will be calling the recursive functions which will contain the root as a smaller tree or you can say a smaller trees root node so what is smaller tree root node it will be 20 or 40 or 50 or 30 or anything which is representing smaller number of nodes less number of nodes so from 10 what are nodes we can call directly we can easily call the left child or we can call the right child by making roots left call or roots right call. what is the order in in order in name only suggest it will be in between both the left and the right calls that is we will be making a call to the left subtree first print all the nodes in the left subtree once all the nodes in the left subtree are printed by making a call to the roots left once roots left is printed then we are going to just also print all the nodes in roots right but the thing is where should we print root itself because if all these nodes will be printed we are expecting they should also be printed in the same in order only all these nodes should be printed in in order only in between them and where will 10 print 10 will get printed between the left subtree and the right subtree in between left and right subtree that is it will be printed in between them so i can say in this case roots value will be printed roots data will be printed so this is obviously a pseudocode i am not writing a proper syntax because it will be it should be language agnostic the pseudocode code but one thing is there what is that thing we will discuss it during the try run so let's just start the try run only while doing the try run we will figure out will this code have any kind of exception occurring or not starting from the root node what we will say we will say first make a call to the roots left child okay for 20 do not print 20 we are not printing roots data before any call first step we are doing is just making a call then after we are returning from that call we will be printing root data so right now 10 is paused when it will return when the function will return to the 10 node then only we will print 10 but right now we are not printing 10 20 will also say the same thing it will make a call to the left subtree because the first step is making an in order call to left root dot left 40 will also say make a call to roots left child this is nothing but depth first traversal we are doing DFS in order to solve in order traversal so from 70 now if I will make a left subtree call where will I reach what is the left child of 70 the left child of 70 is nothing but null there is nothing it means null so I am representing null as a capital n if we are reaching null what should we do should we make a call to roots left is null dot left existing no we cannot say null dot left we cannot say null dot data we cannot say null dot right in that case what should we do which should actually return so if we are reaching to null node if root is a null we should actually just simply return so let's say this is the zeroth line this should be the first possible line before doing all of these three steps we have to ensure if root is null or not if it is null we can't say root is null then null dot left null dot data null dot right so in that case we have to directly simply return because empty tree cannot have a traversal we can't traverse on empty tree same for the right child we will return but before actually the right child we are printing the root node before the right call after the left call we are printing root data that is we will be printing the 70 so let just print 70 not print but actually store it in the list but for now we are printing it that is showing in the output console now make the right call once both the calls are done once printing is done we will finally pop back to the previous function what was the previous function the previous function was 40 only so i will pop back to the previous function from 40 left call is made left call is done in order of left subtree is done that is 70 is printed now we will print root now we will print 40 so 40 is now getting printed and then we will make a call to the right child that is root's right subtree so for 80 first thing will be make a call to left subtree but there is nothing return then print 80 itself so i will print 80 itself and then make a call to the right subtree which is again null so now once all the three steps are done We will actually return because finally if control reaches here, then we are actually just saying pop pop the function does return from the function from 40 again made the left call. We printed 40. We made the right call. All the three steps are done. 40 will also pop to the calling function, 20 called 40, 40 will pop back to 20. Always whenever we return, we return to the calling function from 20 node from the in order of 20. We will say since left call is done now is the time to print 20 so we will print 20 in in order. This is in order. Why? Because all the nodes left subtree of 20 are already printed before 20 now 20 is printed and now 20 will make a call to the right subtree print all the nodes in the right subtree of 20. So we will go to the right subtree for 50 same thing first make a call to left subtree for 90. It is a leaf node. So leaf node does not have any right child right left child. So just make the calls and print in between. So only 90 will get printed and we will return. return to the calling function. Now we can say 50 is getting printed in in order. Why after left call after left sub tree for 50 we will print 50 itself and then we will make a right call but there is actually nothing in right side because it is null there is no right child. So from 50 also we will return to what to the calling function. Now clearly see that after 20 the faith was the expectation was all the nodes in the right child will get printed in in order and yes so for 20 left child nodes right child nodes in in order and in between them the root 20 itself. So this entire thing is done so we will return back from 20 also and now finally for root node 10 the overall root all the nodes in left sub tree are done. Now is the case root will get printed now is the case 10 itself will get printed and after printing 10 what we will do we will make a call to the right sub tree. So let me just show it a different color. We will call to the right sub tree there is no left child So after returning from left, we will print 30 itself. So 30 is getting printed, make a call to the right subtree for 60 first thing left subtree which is 100. Then second thing print itself which is 60. Third thing right subtree which is 110. After all the three things are done left subtree print itself right subtree all the three things are done. We will pop back for 30 all the three things are done left subtree print itself right subtree. We will pop back for 10 also root node also all the three things are done. So finally we will pop back to the main function and all the nodes are printed in in order traversal. I know the dry run was long but we have covered all kind of corner cases that is a root node having two child a node having only one left child right child is null or a node only having right child left child is null or a node having no children that is leaf node. All the cases are covered we are able to write the base case we are able to make two calls and we are also able to. to do the traversal in in order that is print the notes in between both the call after the left call before the right call with that milestone 2 is complete milestone 1 was already complete when we were discussing the problem only now we will be coming up within the milestone number 3 that is instruction manual that is writing the pseudocode there are two things which are already given to us let's refresh the code it might be removed okay so these two lines are already given that is in order list will already be given to you what we have to do with this in order list is we have to fill it by making a recursive call to make a recursive call to in order function by passing root as well as this in order list and in order list but what we have to do is we have to make a recursive function so let's just make a recursive function with void return type why because we will not be returning anything void return type we do not have to return anything we have to just store all the values in the list only which will be as a parameter the public void in order what we are doing is we are passing the root node that is tree node root and we are also passing the second thing which is list of all the nodes in in order the answer the list of all the nodes in in order okay in this recursive function there are four steps to be precise first step the base case that is whenever we are reaching null if we are reaching null the base case is if we are reaching null if root is null we can't do anything we can't say root dot data root dot left root dot right in that case we have to simply return if root is not null make two recursive calls first make a call to left child then make a call to right child make a recursive call to the roots left subtree by updating the root as root dot left and passing list as it is and passing list as it is but what about the right we will make the right call similarly just instead of left we will say root dot right between both these calls for in order in between we will add the root data into the list so add roots data in the in order list in order list and these are the four steps which will be required in order to make a in order recursive function recursive dfs traversal depth first short traversal using recursion we are able to do it in how much time complexity how much space complexity since we are making a recursive call to each and every node once that is we are going to each and every node only one how many nodes are there n nodes are there so overall time complexity will be order of n a linear traversal is there what about space complexity since we are using recursion since recursion uses recursion call stack space or you can say function call stack space we will be having all of these functions getting pushed into a function call stack but at one particular point of time only one branch can be there in function callstack why if we are having 18 the stack 70 is popped because we have already returned from it if we are having 50 in the stack already 70 40 80 are popped so at any point of time only one branch can be there in the function call it means only the depth of the tree will be the space complexity only the height of the tree or depth of the tree will be the space complexity that is recursion callstack space which will go best case logarithmic for a height balance tree and which will go linear for a skewed tree in worst case so we can generally say it is also linear this is also linear because in worst case there will be a singly linkless kind of binary tree a skewed binary tree every node only having either a left child or a right child not both so it will be almost linear so number of levels will all also be linear so space as well as time both are order of n order of n only code for the problem binary tree in order traversal now what we are going to do is first make a recursive call from the main function by calling in order passing root node and also passing the list that is the name in order in java language i am right now doing the code in this function in order four steps are there only four steps base case a left recursive call adding root node that is visiting root and a right recursive call so if the root is null that is root equal to equal to null we can't do any of these three steps so in the base case we have to return we have to make a finite recursion otherwise the recursion will go into a either you can say a null pointer exception or you can say a simply error will be there then we can surely make two calls in order on the roots left child first and then in orders right child in order of the roots right child that is first Just store all the nodes in the left side of root then store all the nodes in right side of root and since it is in order root should be added in between left and right so we have to add the root node in the list in order dot add roots data itself in between the both the calls that is after the left call and before the right call so this is the simple enough code let's just run it to see if the code is working for the sample test case then we will also see about corner cases so it is taking some time to run okay so sample test case is working it is showing me accepted let's just test it for a node a tree which is having only zero nodes that is no nodes are there if the tree is empty traversal should also be empty and our code should be able to handle the empty tree also why because root is null we will return empty tree will be there what about a tree having only one node having value 10 both the left side as well as right side will be minus one minus one minus one null actually we have to give input we don't want to or we don't have to actually know the input format but I am just showing this input for a node for a tree having only one node root node is 10 left child and right child both are null so it should work for that also let's just run it and see output should be only 10 only one node and also it will work for obviously the try run code where we were having a tree with many number of nodes at least 11 nodes were there some of the nodes were having both the children some of the nodes were having only left child some of the nodes were having only right child some of the nodes were having both children as null so let's just submit it to see if it is working for all test cases and already you can see it is working it is showing accepted for all of the test cases so what was the time complexity it was linear what was the space complexity it was also linear why we will be going to each and every node at least or you can say at most once and how many nodes are there n nodes are there that's why it is order of n space is linear because of the recursion call stack space. We will be pushing all the nodes along one branch along one height of the tree. So it will be order of height which can go in worst case order of height due to skewed binary tree due to a linked list kind of binary tree a singly linked list every node only having either the left child or the right child. So with that we are done with the problem binary tree in order traversal."

I don't have anything like maybe the guidance like from seniors that I have gotten from Trio. I have connected with multiple mentors from fine companies to guide us in the right direction. Maybe yeah that is the one. Alright then, thank you so much."

        "transcription": "Hi, I'm Khetesh. I completed my graduation in 2020 as a mechanical engineer and after that I'm into the IT sector. So it's been like 2.5 years of experience in the QA domain as a manual tester. From day zero, I was quite interested in programming, but initially I had no idea like what domain and what fields to choose. I was looking for some mentor and guidance. Then I got to know from one of my friends that Cryo provides a fresh new QA automation program. The curriculum of the program was quite fascinating for me. I got the opportunity as well as the exposure to work with the mentors and industry experts and learn the things in depth. Developing the framework from scratch, then working on some live projects, basically e-commerce projects and traveling projects. All those got the opportunity to work on them and gain experience. experience through cryo I got the knowledge and idea like how to move ahead taking a small small bits and joining them basically connecting each and every dots to make a complete line so it helped me a lot I would suggest everyone who is not from the software or from the IT domain they should definitely look for this program because it enhances your knowledge to a great extent like even if you are not going for a developer but definitely you can opt for an estate profile and I think that the future people can go for this program"

Hi, my name is Pavitra Sharma. I am from Haryana. I completed my graduation in BSc in Computer Science. After that I joined the Cryo2 and start my career in web development and now I join the company name is Tail Boost as a front-end web developer and start learning JavaScript and I started here my web development course in full-stack fellowship program. Here I learn all of my skills related to web development. like how to make any of the layout using Figma and how to make an API like back-end service like complete from back-end and front-end I mean in this program project was the good like just like the real world industry project from using Figma and like from development to testing to deployment basically I don't know like how to test a code and this program like help me to solve this challenge how to test a code every part of the code using unit testing integration testing and end-to-end testing in the program like mentor was good they have like a lot of teaching experience they taught us like very well how to solve the challenges how to give the answer during the interview phase in the cryodo basically taught all of the things like real world challenges how to solve like problem, how to build a logic in any of the problem. The Cryo2 have the interview sessions and peer-to-peer mock interview to help the people to solve things in the interviewer. If they join the Cryo2, they make a career path in any of the phase like from front-end, back-end and full-stack. But as of my perspective I learned from the Cryo2 and I say Cryo2 is the best or a learning path to switch their career from any part of the things."

So I did a little research about how I can get into IT. So I got to know about Cryo. I did attended the lectures. I found it very interesting. And because of that, I enrolled for the Cryo. I was looking for like a good start in IT field by gaining experience and knowledge about the front-end and back-end. Cryo did help me a lot in getting the knowledge of front-end and back-end. The project they gave me, like the lectures they taught me. If I get stuck in any problem, I wish to get good mentorship from the mentors. It was really helpful for me to understand how the things actually work and start building the projects by myself. I enjoyed the most was the projects because those were like very interesting projects to do. Even if I get stuck in any problem, I should get good mentor support. During the start, I was not able to like achieve the outputs and everything. But with the help of the mentorship, I was able to achieve what methodology we should use and how the code should look, how can the code look clean. So, it was really helpful for me because I also did attain the extra sessions for coding. So, it really helped me to improve the way I write the code. So, it was one of the best experience I have in the Learning Courage because I was not aware of anything like how the coding actually works and how to write code. But with the help of Frivo, I was able to easily achieve that during the learning process."

        "transcription": "Are you confused about what career path to choose? Is it easier to learn front-end compared to back-end development? But what about the pay? Which one pays more? And since you're in the middle of your choices, you must have also come across full-stack development. If full-stack is a combination of both front-end and back-end, does that mean it pays more and has a better career choice? Hi, I'm Ritwik. And today we are going to decode these burning questions for you. And by the end of this video, you'll have a clear choice of which path you want to take and grow your career in software development. And before we begin, be sure to hit that bell icon after subscribing So you can stay tuned to the career guidance we are creating for you in this video series. Let's start by understanding what each of these roles mean. When you log into your Netflix profile, what do you see? A list of shows and movies. And when you click on the down arrow for more information, you get a glimpse of the show or the movie. You see a trailer. You can read one to two lines of description about it. What genre it falls in. And information about the cast and so on. And if you have already started watching a movie, you can resume right where you left. Have you ever thought where Netflix gets all this information from? Where does it store all this data and how does Netflix keep a track of what you're watching? Let's understand this by comparing it with the three different roles, front-end, back-end and full-stack. The list of shows and movies, their trailers and all that information you saw about the show or a movie on the screen is what basically front-end is all about. And how Netflix stored and retrieved the information behind the scene is what back-end is about. You can be someone who specializes in building either the front-end or the back-end of an application. And if you want to get involved in building both aspects of the software, you can explore full-stack development. Each role is exciting in its own way, so you have to understand that none is superior or inferior to the other. Front-end and back-end are specialist roles, so you go deeper into your area of expertise. Full-stack role is slightly broader, so you tend to pick up both front-end and back-end skills, but not at the same depth as a specialist. To help you choose your role, let's look at a few factors you can consider before making your final decision. If you're enjoying watching this video so far, do let us know by smashing that like button. And which role seems exciting to you so far? Let us know in the comments section.  how you can double down on that decision. Now that you know what each term means and what each role entails, it's time to choose what kind of software developer you want to be. Although this decision depends on your own ideas and opinions, here are a few aspects you can consider before making your final decision. Not many think about this, but it is definitely an important factor to consider the size of the company you are planning to join. Larger companies hire specialists like front-end developer or back-end developer, whereas small to medium sized companies hire both specialists and generalists. There is another dimension to a company, which is project size. Larger companies might sometimes hire full stack developers in smaller teams for working on experimental features and prototypes. Also, large IT service companies look for full stack developers as they can work on a client project end-to-end. So you can keep this in mind when you are picking a role and applying for jobs. The next thing to consider is your interest. Do you love to build UI? Do you have a keen eye for design, usability, and aesthetics? Then you may like front-end development. If you like working on problems related to scaling, implementing business logic, and performance optimization, etc, then you should consider back-end development. If you want to explore both parts before you choose anyone to specialize in, full stack is a great option. option for you. Your next question may be how quickly can I learn these skills and land a job? Front-end skills are relatively easier to pick up and get a job. So if you are from a non-technical background, we would recommend you to get started with front-end roles. Back-end and full-stack roles both require you to have a bit more breadth across operating systems, networks, and databases. Also, the typical interview processes for both these roles involves a bit more DSA compared to front-end roles. Hope by now you have a fair idea of which field you want to pick. You must be wondering about the salary potential in each of these roles. Honestly, since you're just starting out in software industry, don't optimize your role based on your pay alone. You will be able to get good high-paying jobs in all three roles. Instead, focus on getting into the right company and working with the right team and mentor to guide you in your job. Remember this, you can never go wrong in choosing a specific role when you start your career. If you're proactive with your decisions, you can guide your career in the right direction. You can either start as a generalist and specialize at a later point or start as a specialist and generalize at a later point in your career. Both ways work and it depends on how you want to grow your career. So even if you start as a full-stack engineer, you will most likely specialize in front-end or back-end as you go. In other words, you will never be a 50% front-end and a 50% back-end developer. Similarly, if you start as a front-end or back-end developer, you will be picking up a bit of the other skills. And it will come in handy as you grow further in your career. If you found this video helpful in choosing your career path, let us know by liking the video.

        "transcription": "Online co-editors are an absolute blessing in disguise. There have been multiple instances where I have used them and I'm sure you would have used them too. Be it our daily work or recruiting, they are used extensively in the software field. Have you ever wondered how would you go about creating your very own such platform? Don't worry. In today's video, we'll discuss how do we create such an editor. We'll be creating an online platform where you can put in your HTML, JS and CSS code and see how the webpage would look right away. No waiting. No local setup. How about that? What's more? After completing this project, you will get a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, event-based animation and many more such things. Are you excited? So without much further ado, let's get into it. Before we get started, there are some prerequisites to this project. You should know a little bit of HTML, CSS, jQuery or JavaScript. If you do not know that, as always, please do not worry. We have all the useful references and study material for you in our Cryo projects hub page and we strongly recommend doing this project and learning these technologies along the way. In doing so, you will have a kick-ass working application which you have created instead of having some code snippets and some written notes. So coming to the steps of development, what steps we need to accomplish to have a functioning online platform, right? So first would be, you know, develop the basic HTML site structure, right? So we have, you know, our forms, our text boxes, what have you. So after we have the HTML frame, we'll use CSS to style it. Then we'll have the core functionality implemented using jQuery or JavaScript which would be the animations, you know, a dynamic rendering in the iframe. But after we have these three steps completed, the project would be totally functional. Now we need to host this project. So for that... we'll use github pages for publishing right so we'll have a hosted online application we've already seen the snippet of the video how the code editor would look eventually but let's have a look again so as you can see here we have three text areas three text boxes one for html one for css and one for js when i press the run button you can see that the code is getting rendered right away so let's start discussing how do we build this coming to the first step which is prototyping and getting started we'll do this so that we have an idea of how the project would be right so we'll start with downloading jquery then we'll create a folder structure as such right we have it here you know the description of the folder structure now we have a couple of useful tips for you now you'll be developing continuously right you'll be making changes to the code editor again and again again so you'll have to go and you know refresh the web page or the browser to see what changes you have made you know how they look in the front end for that we have thing called a live server right so we have the extensions for vs code and atom if i were to open just for vs code you can install this live server and what it will do is it will enable auto refresh so as soon as you do a code change and save the web page would automatically get refreshed so you wouldn't have the hassle of refreshing it again and again iteratively and if you're not using vs code or atom then you can use npm or the python server right now if you're an absolute beginner or you need a refresher with html css we have this very useful cryo byte for you so this would again be a stage-based learning process so as you can see we have other bytes as well you know if you feel like exploring you can do that so we have html and css byte here so you know this is again as i said before stage-based learning you can read through this as you feel you can go ahead right we have the setup and the further processes so now we have a see we have downloaded jQuery, we have the live server running so that as soon we make code changes and save it will you know reflect on the browser and we have refreshed HTML and CSS using cryo bytes. Coming to the next step which would be creating the basic HTML bare-bones website you know the frame using list you can create the HTML CSS and JS buttons with the text fields and the result button as well. So whatever HTML components you create make sure that you have relevant classes and divisions for them right. This would be really helpful when you later on you will be doing the CSS styling. So after you have created your basic HTML web page it should look somewhat like this right. I will be creating three text area containers for HTML CSS and JS where you will be you know putting in the code. Now you need to wrap the run button with an iframe element. Iframe is used for rendering a web page within a web page right. So we have some more useful links for you here which are the styling tips and the iframe sandbox. So you can read up about it here. Coming to the next step, we have created the bare bones HTML frame. Now we will be using CSS to style it. So here are a couple of examples on how you can create the class and the IDs for the elements you have. Then based on the substructures you have, right, the class and IDs, however you group it, you can style it, you can style the substructures, right. So we have a snippet for you here. While styling the webpage, the Chrome dev tool can be very helpful. So we have some links for you here, right. Again we have the cryobytes here, you know, which would have the step-by-step process on how to use the developer tools, right. So we have the two cryobytes link here and we have a couple of more references for you. One suggestion we have is that you can go to JS bin and draw some inspiration from there, right. So it's a simple code editor and we recommend JS bin because it's fairly elementary, right. If you wish, you can. can try to create it somewhat like this and later on you know style it as you go. Now coming to the step which will you know breathe life into our code editor which is you know powering up with jquery. So there are two ways of importing jquery. We have a link for you here which would help you explore them further right. So that is for you to do. Now whatever logic or functionalities you have make sure you wrap them up with the dot ready because as soon as the DOM is ready we can we can use these functions and events right. Now we'll first implement the logic of you know dynamically assigning the height to your code container. So we have a code snippet for you here which will be a good reference. Then after we have the height adjustment we need to add the logic which would toggle you know these fields. You know example is this when I press CSS it comes up again it goes away right. So I can just have. But I can just have you know one tab at a time so that you know I can see whatever is getting rendered. Right. Right. So now the last functionality to do is that we have this run with JS. So as soon as we press this whatever code we have gets rendered into the iframe. For doing this you can use the dot contents method along with the selector for the iframe. So what we essentially need to do is take all the code from the HTML CSS and JS text areas you know and put it in the iframe. Now this code collectively is called the source document. We have a link for you here. So this would give you a certain idea of you know what the iframe source document is. So here again we have a snippet for you on how you know the code should look like after it's done. Then we have some references you know a guide to jQuery selectors. So if you go through all. the references you'll have all the essential information required to complete this project. So we have completed the three essential steps which are first creating the bare-bones HTML structure, second creating the CSS styling, third making the project functional using jQuery or JS. Now we just need to make sure that whatever code we have functions properly right we have the proper classes and division identifiers the styling is dynamic you know whenever we change the screen size it responds appropriately and the project is completely functional it works end-to-end. After we have done this the last step is publishing it on github pages. This project a real favorite of mine because you know you can show a functional project without any setup because you have hosted it on github pages right. So here's a quick guide on how to host your project on github pages if you go through this I'm sure you will be able to host it. That is all the info you need to make this project on your own. Now coming to the brass tacks, what do you get out of making this project? First of all, you will have a hosted application which you can show anywhere in an interview. This will make your resume much, much, much stronger. You will have a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS and jQuery and DOM manipulation on the go. You will learn how to render web pages in an iframe. You will learn how to do event-based animations and jQuery manipulations to a web page. These are very essential and pivotal skills for a full-stack developer. And you get all these just by doing this one project. And what's more, the first three participants to complete this project with a great design would get cryo goodies. So after you have completed this project, paste your GitHub links in the comments and we will get back to you. Now I know this project has got you all excited and you want to start right away, but please share this video with all your friends so that there's some healthy competition and it's much more. fun to work with others. If you have any doubts about this project or any suggestions for the upcoming project you know the project topic, the tech stack please let us know by commenting and if you liked the video then like the video and subscribe to our channel and press the bell icon so that whatever projects we have next you get notified about them. So that's it for this video see you in the next one"

And so I thought I would leverage Cryo to learn development and gain some project experience. So that was my major motivation behind learning at Cryo. Cryo has some industry-grade projects. Based on that, I actually got to know how codes really work in big industries and what are the best coding practices, how unit testing, everything works. All of that was summed up pretty good in Cryo course. There was a lot of avenues at Cryo. One of them was learning by doing. The second one was there was good mentor experience. They even had a placement service, which was decent. I also interacted with Sridhar sir and Ratna sir. My major reason why I would rate Cryo above any video course for that matter is because they have a unique methodology called learn by doing. At every point of time, I know exactly what I'm doing because I'm provided with a set of resources and a set of tasks, which I have to implement. Every piece of code that I write, I get to know about and wherever I struggle, I ask for help or I push myself even harder to overcome that. I would say it was a good struggle and I got to learn a lot from that struggle. It was worth it."

        "transcription": "Hello everyone, welcome back in this particular video, we will be discussing the problem longest substring without a repeating character what we are given is a string what we need to find is the length of the longest substring which has no repeating characters. So we have to find such a substring only the length of it which is the longest first of all but obviously the longest substring of a string of n length will be n only so the constraint is the longest substring should not have any repeating characters that is all the characters should be unique all the characters should be different if you are able to find such a substring print the length among all those substrings the valid substrings find the maximum length actually so let's take the first example to understand the problem if the example given is double a b triple c C, B, C, B. If this is the string given to us, what is the longest substring without repeating characters or with no repeating characters? If I take A, I can only take one times A, either this one or this one. But if I take this one A, I can also take B. In fact, I can also take C because all the three characters are different. But now I cannot take the next C because it will be repeating. If you will start from this C character, you will only be able to take two characters. Similarly, from B, only two characters can be taken if you don't want repeating. So the actual maximum length will come out to be for the substring A, B, C, which is C only. So output is C. Similarly, if we take the example C, and then a lot of Ds are there. In the second example, as you can see, there will be only two length string which is having different characters. Because as soon as you take one more D, it will be repeating. You don't have to take repeating characters. So these are some simple examples, sample description only. But what about some... Difficult test cases some enhanced test cases so far that I am taking a string containing a b p then let's take let's take the characters with some distance in between them a b c b then let's take maybe let's take d let's take e let's take f let's take g let's take a then f then let's take g again and let's take now maybe e if this is the string given to us we need to find the longest substring with it which is not having any repeated characters so what is the longest substring as you can figure out which is not having repeating if I will take this d I will not be able to take this d that is till this point and till which previous index then there is a I will have to stop my loop or stop my substring till any repeating character and most probably what we can do is we can take all of these characters as you can see because there is no character being repeated in this entire substring so I think the longest substring without repeating characters will come out to be this one let's just make it little bit smaller by making some other character also repeated that is let's also take this character as the character which is g and let's now try to figure out the longest substring so one of the approach which you can actually use to find the longest substring length is just by figuring out each and every substring find all the substrings and once you are able to find all the substrings check whether that substring is having any duplicate characters or not if it is having duplicate discard it if it is not having duplicate if it is only having unique characters then take and out of all of them find the minimum length substring So one of the approach to find all the substrings can be just run a loop for the start point of the substring and another loop a nested loop inner loop for the end point of the substring that is a till b a till c a till b a till g and so on similarly b till c b till b b till g and so on so one loop for start pointer one another loop for end pointer and then third loop for finding the number of unique characters or finding the different characters but what you can do is instead of just having three loops which will take n cube time complexity you can also just combine the logic for the end pointer with the counting of unique characters that is while you are just including every end character in the substring in and forming a new substring just count how many unique characters are there are there number of unique characters equal to the substring length if it is then all characters are unique so that would only take two loops but still its time complexity will be n square which is a good enough solution for a brute force that is a basic solution but not going to be suffice for the most optimized solution when it comes to most optimized solution we have to think in maybe linear time complexity that is even better than n square and when it comes to linear time complexity we have to run a single loop while running over the string we have to check whether the current character which we are including is already there or not if it is already there we should only include it once that is it will start from starting A is present right now only once B is present right now only once C is right now present only once but as soon as I take next B it is already present and if it is already present I have to discard it but since I want a substring some strings are contiguous same as subarrays you can't have a character in between which you are discarding right away you can't have a substring 0 to 3 you have to have a contiguous substring have to discard b you also have to discard a because if you want this particular substring this particular b character you have to discard all characters till the previous b then i will do what i will include g i will include e because it is unique i will include f i will include g but as soon as i include g as you can see g is already there so exclude or discard all the characters till the previous d including previously why because we can't take repeated characters so where is the last occurrence of the current character present that we need to store in some data sector because we can't run another loop to find where is the last time g was occurring where is the last time b was occurring that will obviously take n square time complexity overall so what we can do is we can maintain some data sector which will show the last occurrence of a character and what is the best data sector to search whether what is the last occurrence and also to insert the last occurrence of a character since we need the character comma the last occurrence of that character that is the interior value. So we need a pair of care comma in we need a pair of two types of data the character corresponding to the last index and what is the best data sector which will store all the key value pairs. It will be a hash map or you can say we have to use hashing algorithms. So key will be nothing but the character value will be nothing but the last index where the character is present. So we are going to make a hash map or you can say we are going to use a hashing algorithm. Hash map is known as different things in different languages. It might be known as unordered map also. Once we are making a hash map of the key value pair as character combined, we will check whether the character is present in this current substring or not. But for the current substring, we need to have two pointers that the left pointer and right pointer. Where is the current substring starting? Where is the current substring ending? That is when we are having the substring A till C, it is from 0 to 2. But now when I will include the third character I have to discard the zeroth index and the first index that is now the substring will be from 2 to 3 then I will include 4 5 but then I will include as soon as 7 the g index again I have to discard all the occurrences till previous g so new substring will be from 5 to 7 that is left till right so we have to maintain two integer variables two indices left pointer and right pointer initially we can assume that both the pointers will be at zeroth index or we can assume both the pointers are empty the current substring which is having unique character is empty what we are going to do is right pointer will try to include elements in the substring as you can see because whenever we are going to a new character we are including it in the substring but what will a left character do or the left index do the left index will try to remove all the characters till the previous index that is if I am saying I am including this v I will exclude all the occurrences till previously so left pointer will help me in doing that it will exclude all the previous occurrences so initially h map will be empty and we are going to start the logic by including characters using right excluding characters using left so left will be used for exclude right will be used for include let's start including first of all because we will only exclude if there is repeating character we have to try to get the maximum length and in order to get maximum length we have to include as many characters as possible so let's start by including first if we are including a is it repeating no in the hash map there is no character present which is having value a so we can include a no problem and now the last occurrence of a can be said as zeroth index a is presented zeroth index key value pair character comma integer next let's try to include b but before that we also have to find the maximum substring length so currently what is the length of the substring you can can say the current length of the substring is right minus left 1 minus 0 that is 1 length only a was a substring so the maximum length will be right minus left so you can say the length if I am saying the length variable is the answer it will be right minus left which is 1 right now initially it can be 0 because it is empty but now it is 1 and we will check can we include B also yes we can include B because it is not present till now at the first index we will include it can we include C also yes we can include C at the second index and also the length will become 2 and now as soon as you do third index the 3 minus 0 will be 3 length now if you will include B B is already there B is at the first index is the first index within the substring is it within left to right yes of course first index is within the substring so within the same substring we can't have two occurrences of the same character we can't have repeating characters so what we need to do we need to update the left pointer to discard all the characters till the previous B till the first index so if I am going to discard all of these characters till the previous B index what we need to do is what we need to do is we have to just update the left pointer and go to the previous index of B plus 1 that is from 2 to 3 will be the new substring and of course as soon as I will do right plus plus I will check what is the length length will be 4 minus 2 which is 2 it is not the longest length but it is having unique characters only C, B it is only having unique characters even if you are not doing right plus plus if you want to calculate length before doing right plus plus you can do right minus left plus 1 that is 3 minus 2 plus 1 is the length there are 2 characters so 3 minus 2 plus 1 now what we are going to do since B is already discarded so it will let remain B at the first index in the hash map actually no why because now in current substring as you can see b is present at the third index so while we are discarding the element and including it we should update the index in the hashmap also we should make the b occurrence at third index so g we will include at the fourth index because it is occurring for the first time what is the substring length 4 minus 2 plus 1 i have not updated right pointer till now so 4 minus 2 plus 1 will be 3 3 is already the answer so don't update it we have to find the maximum answer can we include e is not present in the substring as well as it is not present in the hashmap as you can see so we can include it at the fifth index as as soon as i include it i will say 5 minus 2 plus 1 is a 4 length 4 all is also the maximum substring the longest substring now i will try to include f f is also not present so f we can also include at sixth index now see carefully we are having g character g is already present in the current substring at the fourth index as you can see in the hash map also and now since g is present we have to discard it so we have to discard only g no we have to discard all characters till g that is left will become the previous occurrence of g which can be calculated or which can be fetched from the hash map which is fourth index so make the left index become four plus one go to the next index of that thing so left will become fifth index what is the length the length is seven minus five plus one three length it is not more than four but should we also update the occurrence of g and now the seventh index the current index yes because next time it will be there it will be present at the seventh index not the fifth index next we will check whether a is already present or not and you will see that a present in the hash map although is a present in the substring the current substring is not including all these characters actually all these characters till zero to four a is present at zeroth index the last of a was at zero index in the current substring a is not repeating so no problem you should not update left pointer we should not say that discard a although what we should do is we should update the occurrence of a we should say a is now occurring at the 8 index that we should need to do but we can't say that left pointer will become 0 plus 1 or the previous occurrence of a plus 1 because that is already discarded a is not repeating and what is the length it is 8 minus 5 plus 1 4 length only 4 is already the maximum right plus plus f should be discarded f the last occurrence was at 6 index it is within the string 6 is within the string it is more than equal to left and if it is within the substring what we need to do discard all the characters till last occurrence that is make the left become 6 plus 1 last occurrence of f plus 1 and also update the f occurrence as 9 the current index right index right plus plus what is the last occurrence of g g is last occurrence is 7 so since it is equal to left we are taking the from left till right so will discard G that is we will make left become 7 plus 1 and also update the G's occurrence as a 10 the current substring length is of course only 3 do not update the answer then we will make the character E is it present in the string it is present at fifth index it is not within the substring so it is already discarded if it is already discarded don't discard it what is the length it is 4 it is also the maximum so finally we can say as soon as the right pointer is becoming plus plus there is no more characters to be included and if there are no more characters to be included the approach is done and finally we are able to say the longest substring length which is not having any extra characters not repeating characters is 4 length in how much time since we were running a single loop on the array on the string only one time like you can say using left pointer plus using right pointer n plus n it will be linear only and what about the optimized approach space complexity since we are going to use a hash map data structure extra data structure the space complexity will also be linear because in worst case there can be the entire string having different characters although it is not possible you can only have 256 different types of characters so you can also say it is order of 256 in worst case but in general if it will not be a string if it will be array in that case it will be linear only so you can say it is either order of 256 which is almost constant or you can also say it is linear in terms of if there are all the characters different or all the elements are different while applying the two-pointer technique and which kind of two-pointer technique it is the approach which we are actually using since we are having a window from left to right but this window size is not fixed you sometimes the window size is increasing sometimes the window size is decreasing but window is shifting it is sliding so it is a sliding window technique but Since the sliding window is not of the same size, it is a dynamic sliding window technique. So the current approach, the most optimized approach which we have discussed is known as dynamic sliding window approach where we are having a window from left to right of substring which is shifting and also increasing decreasing size according to left and right pointer. So let's do what let's go to the instruction manual actually let's write the instruction manual. So first of all, what we have to do is we have to create a hash map of P as character and value as integer that is the character. What is the last occurrence of that character in terms of index initially we will have empty hash map but one by one we will run a loop over the string on the right index on the right character. So run a for loop run a for loop over right character why because right character is going to include the characters over right index from zero to strings length. 1 so 2 strings last character 2 strings last index that is n minus 1 if string is of n characters so while running the loop for right character what we will do we will try to include it first of all but before including it if it is already present we have to discard it by updating the left and where should we initially set left as we can initially set the left as 0th index only so set left pointer as 0th index only 0 value and then check is the previous occurrence of the current character is if the previous occurrence of current character of the current character current character at the right index is within the string is within the string within the substring that is it is in the range left till right what we can say is we have to discard all the characters then what we have to do is then update the left as what update left as the previous occurrence plus one previous occurrence or previous index you can say plus one previous index of the character and how will you get the previous index you will get it from the hash mark so if the previous index of the correct current character we can let it stored first of all in a variable to store previous occurrence of current character at right current character at right in a variable in a variable let's say previous and now instead of all of this we can just say if previous is within the range of the substring if it is within the substring then update the left as previous plus 1 so first get it in a variable using what using hash map now after we are getting the updated left pointer we will also update the hash map that is we will also put the character with the current index in hash mark we will update the hash mark now we will check what is the length is it the maximum length because every time whatever the window is we have to check the length of the window by doing right minus left plus one and initially what should we assume the answer that answer length as zero because initially we can assume it is empty length now we have to find maximum or we can say store maximum of what of answer and right minus left plus one in answer only that is update the answer with whatever is the new maximum and finally we have to return the answer so this is going to be the approach for finding the length of the longest abstract without repeating characters using a hash map that is linear time linear space with that we will be writing the code so first thing we discussed was we have to create a hash map because we need to store where is the last key or last index where the current character is present so for that we will be creating a hash map of key as a character value as integer and let's say the hash map name is HM we can name it anything as you want we have to set the left pointer because for a sub string or a sub array we need a left pointer and a right pointer the starting index and the ending index left pointer will start from 0 and also the answer variable should be set to 0 both of these variables we have to set to 0 value so let's just set them in the same line the left as well as answer length the maximum substring length will be 0 we will run a loop for the right index because for right always we have to include one character so for right pointer we are starting from 0 going till the last character that is strings dot length minus 1 and what we have to do is we have to check what is the character whether the character is a repeated character or a non repeating character so for that let's just check whether that same character is already present or not so i am storing the character in a variable although you can directly use it also it is your choice so string dot char at right i am storing it in a variable ch and i am checking whether that character at right is already available in the hash map or not if it is not available we can consider it as minus one or null or anything so check the previous occurrence we can say get the previous occurrence in a variable which is previous is nothing but hash map dot get the current character or the character at right or even if you just want to directly use it like this you can also use it like this so get the previous occurrence if it is within the string length within the substring left to right that it is more than or equal to left pointer if previous is more than or equal to left pointer but before that we also have to check whether previous exists or not because if previous is null then we can't do anything that means if it is not existing till now obviously we don't have to discard any characters so if it is not equal to null and if it is within the substring then only discard the characters till the previous index that is left up will get updated as previous index plus one and as soon as we are doing it what we have to do is we are also going to update the hash map with the new key value pair so we will say in the hash map just put for the same character that is s dot char at right the new index that is a right index current index store maximum we are always trying to update the window with the maximum length possible right pointer will include characters left pointer will discard characters or exclude characters whatever the current substring the current window length is that is from left to right window length will be right minus left plus one check if it is maximum or not so answer will be maximum of math dot max of answer till now or right minus left plus one. Whatever is the nuance new answer. We will update it and finally we will return the answer. So let's just run this board. It was having a simple single loop only not that much parts or components to be honest. It was just having a single flow. If you are able to understand the flow you are able to get the logic also or you can say why we are using hash bar. So as you can see the sample test case is working as perfect as it can let's just submit it and see if all the test cases are also getting accepted or not even including the corner cases if there are any so as you can see all the test cases are getting accepted. It will also just see whether the previous character is including or not. So there is no corner case as such and since the string should be at least of one length. We are saying that and there will always get updated even if the input string is an empty string still we are saying the answer is zero only. because empty string is of zero length so there is no corner case as such but as you can see we are running a loop over the string for n characters the loop will run for n times inside the loop we are just using put operation or get operation these operations are constant in average case for a hash map in java so overall we can say the loop or the entire code in total will take linear time and since we are using a hash map in worst case it can consist of 256 different kinds of characters so in worst case it will be order of 256 although if you consider instead of a string if there is was an array you can just say it is linear because in that case it will be having in worst case n different pairs where n is the array size so that is the time and space complexity and with that we are done with the problem find the longest substring without a repeating character"

How interesting. So what is the best part about your job? I think challenges every day, there is something new to learn every day, and that just keeps me motivated to work even more. I work at the back-end team for menu, so whatever pages that you see on the app, my restaurant pages, those are being handled by me. So yeah, it's always like under the pump, a lot of customers, we have a lot of users on the app, like every minute, 45,000. So yeah, that's what keeps me motivated to work. Must be nice, no, when people can actually see your work on the phone, like every day. Yeah, even that gives me a sense of responsibility as well, because for me, whatever I do on the back-end, I do it on the front-end. So yeah, that's what keeps me motivated to work. Must be nice, no, when people can actually see your work on the phone, like every day. So yeah, that's what keeps me motivated to work. Must be nice, no, when people can actually see your work on the front-end, like every  backend, it just reflects on the app directly. So just a single piece of code change or let's say production bug can be impacting so many lives at once, right?

I'm sure a lot of us in the audience dream of working in product based companies, right? And all these winners here have unlocked that dream, right? So let's take a look at the winners in this category. We have four winners in this category. First up, we have Subir Dutta. Now, Subir started out as an Associate Application Developer at Accenture. This was an apprenticeship role in Accenture after which he was refused a full-time role, right? So that was when Subir decided to upskill with Cryo.io. He then cracked the Software Developer role at Sony. Truly inspiring and congratulations, Subir. I actually got an opportunity to talk with Subir. be it earlier this year and I'm extremely happy for you on being winning this award it's truly deserved. All right next up our winner for exceptional career transition service to product award goes to Pranjal Vora. Pranjal made an awe-inspiring transition from being a system engineer at Infosys to becoming an SDE at JumboTail. Interestingly Pranjal is here with us today. Would you like to say a couple of words to our audience Pranjal? Yes sure. So you won the exceptional career transition services to product. So how do you feel about the victory? Great great and yeah let me share the credit. From the 7th sem I have decided that I want to be a front-end developer and the day I joined Infosys I decided that I will leave to Infosys within a one year of span and I will switch my career into front-end developer. So yeah and then I started my study like doing javascript and jquery by myself but I didn't able to get those things in my mind, even though I go through all those things twice or thrice. But then I was looking for a manager or someone who can guide me so that I can be a front-end developer. And luckily, in my mind, Cryo was there. Even Cryo started in 2018. Back in my mind, Cryo was there. But I didn't give a shot to Cryo. And I think that let me take a leap of faith and believe in Cryo that it will convert me into a great developer. And Cryo did that amazingly. So then Cryo has also helped me in such a way that my fundamentals of JavaScript and React are so much clear that I can read and learn advanced concepts all by myself. Cryo has also planted a seed of curiosity and a habit of reading documents in me. And I really want to thank all of the mentors who teach me full stack, print manager Chetan, mentors who are always there to help me to solve my doubts and or when I have doubt regarding any concepts. Also, I want to thank Nikita and Eswaria from Cryo career success team. And all the members of the Cryo staff will help me to reach where I am now today. And last but not the least, I would like to thank the founders of the Cryo who have built such an amazing and great and awesome platform to learn. That's amazing. You said Cryo has planted a seed of curiosity. What better compliment there is, right? Thank you very much, Pranjal, and congratulations. I hope all your endeavors come out beautiful. Thank you very much for joining in, and congratulations. Yes. Thank you. All right. Moving on, our third winner in the category of exceptional career transition services to product is Chetan Gundegaon. So Chetan used to work as a lab automation engineer, and he then moved and cracked the role of an SDE at Amazon in the year of 2020. Congratulations, Chetan! If you are here in the audience, congratulations! Really amazing! Alright, our final winner in this category is Gauri Manohari. So, Gauri had an amazing transition from Accenture, where she was a support engineer, to Altimetric. It's a subsidiary of Amazon as a software developer. Congratulations, Gauri! All the winners in this category truly deserve the awards. Congratulations, Subir, Ranjal, Chetan and Gauri!"

But while doing that job, I was searching for other opportunities. And there I realized that the skills which the market is demanding is much more than what I have. Then I got to know about Cryo. In Cryo, along with placement, we had a chance to upskill ourselves. So I joined Cryo. Along with getting a job, I wanted to upskill myself so that I'll be market ready is what I expected from the Cryo. And Cryo helped me through it. I have a bit of knowledge on manual testing. But along with manual testing, I learned automation and postman as well, which helped me to land this job. I didn't have any coding experience before. Now I can automate web applications. Before whenever I was given a problem, I immediately tried to write the coding part. Here, we had the five steps. By analyzing the problem, I was able to understand the problem in much better way. There is a community built. So, we talked with each other, my cryo mates, and we helped out each other a lot.

When it comes to service industries, India is ahead. And then in a lot of technologies, let's say our Swiggy and many things like that. In a way, we like to simplify things and that's why we depend so much on tech. So that means tech advanced. But that is not the case here. When people are very self-reliant, they do not depend more on tech. Because of the way we have grown up, we have learned things and then we have seen things, our tech knowledge is much better when it comes to people who are present in the other countries or in the abroad. I would say definitely they are more intelligent, but then whatever is there in the tech space in India definitely puts you a little ahead than the rest of them.

        "transcription": "Are you making a move from a QA to a developer role? Well, here's a question for you. Say you're the engineering manager in VMware and you're looking for someone to fill the position of a back-end developer role. You get these three resumes. Who would you actually hire for the role? Resume 1 is a professional who has two years of experience in QA and nothing related to the job you are hiring for. Would you call Ankur for an interview? I guess not. Now, let's look at resume 2. Devesh has worked as a software developer and has decent experience in the skills you are looking for. You're surely going to call him, right? What about resume 3? This is another QA profile, but wait. Neha has worked on a significant number of development projects outside the scope of her actual work. Interesting. Even though the resumes of Ankur and Neha are that of a QA professional, who do you think has a higher chance of getting the call for a developer role? And why do you think that? And why do you think that? Hi, I'm Hrithvik, and today I'm going to show you what it takes to transition from a QA to a software developer role, what you need to do at every step, and some of the less known tricks that will help you get there. But before we begin, hit that subscribe button if you're new to the channel. And let us know in the comments in how many months are you looking to make this transition. Typically for any role, the first step is to get your resume shortlisted. And the next would be cracking the interview. And if you want to get through these two stages, you need a project to showcase your tech skills, deep understanding of the tech used in your project, and a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms and system design. Working on projects that demonstrate your development skills are definitely going to help you stand out, and surely going to increase the chance of you transitioning into a developer role. Remember, I asked you about whether you would call Ankur or Neha? What was your answer? I'm guessing that you chose Neha only because of the projects she has shown. And there's one more important major factor which makes a huge difference, which is your ears of work. experience. Let's see how. If you have less than five years of work experience, it's fairly simple to get a job by working on tech projects and preparing well for your interview rounds. If you're still not convinced how projects can make a difference, remember resume 2. The reality is that you're going to be competing against candidates who have worked the same number of years as you but in a pure development role. Projects give you a fairly equal chance to get shortlisted for the role. Let me explain this in a better way. Say we have applied to 10 companies. If you had past experience in development, you would have probably got an interview call from 7 out of these 10 companies. But since you're from a QA background, only because of your projects and inclination to learn, you could get shortlisted by 5 out of these 10 companies. Still, a good chance, right? The secret here is to apply for as many companies as possible to increase the chances of you getting shortlisted. Another thing is, most hiring managers are open to evaluating for the role if you show sufficient proof of work in your resume. They understand that most engineers may not have had the choice of of choosing a role when they joined their first company. This is especially true when you get placed straight after college. You get trained for the job, and then you're assigned to a role based on your company's plan. So once you have decided to switch to a dev role, start looking for opportunities in your current company where you can improve your coding skills. You can build tools for your team, automate tests instead of doing them manually, fix small bugs in projects. Also, when you file a bug, try to debug the code and find out where that bug is. Code as much as you can in whatever opportunities you can get. But when you're doing this, be careful not to step on the toes of your dev team. Talk to them and let them know that you're doing these things to pick up the development skills. Get their feedback on your work and ask them to guide you. They would be more than happy to help you when you approach their work this way. Additionally, if you would have done quite a bit of QA automation or SDET, where you wrote a lot of code, then it would make your transition even easier. Once you have a solid portfolio, the next step is to get ready to... questions thrown at you in the DSA and system design rounds. Most of the companies hire primarily through data structures and algorithms interview. If you don't know where or how to get started with your DSA prep, you can concentrate mainly on the topics in our DSA plan video. The link for the video is in the description. So, this is how you can approach this transition plan. If you have less than 5 years of experience, and of course, if you follow this plan, you will see a significant improvement in your CTC as well. Now, let's talk about what it takes to transition if you have more than 5 years of work experience. Goes without saying that your first steps are to make sure you do everything mentioned in the previous case, where you have less than 5 years of experience. If you want, you can pause here and take a quick snapshot of these points. However, when a manager sees that you are making this shift after 5 years of your career, they might be a little hesitant to take your application forward. They are going to wonder why you stayed in QA for over 5 years and they might be a little skeptical about your drive to transition to this role. Another concern they might have is how comfortable you would be taking help and instructions from someone else. younger in your team. These are valid concerns but this isn't the end of the road for you. You can prove your drive to make this transition and I'm going to show you how. And before we jump into the specifics, do drop a comment and let us know which category you fall into. Less than 5 years or more than 5 years of experience. And if you're stuck anywhere in the middle of your journey, reach out to us in the comment section. Alright, now we are going to look at these 5 simple strategies that you can use to convince your hiring manager that you are the right candidate for the developer role. Before you look for any opportunities outside, see if you can transition within your current company. Talk to your higher management and given that the functional knowledge you already have about the product. Also, most companies place high regard in their employees growth. Instead of losing a smart and dedicated employee, they would be happy to help and support your decision to help you grow in the current organization. An important tip here is, when you have this conversation with your manager, be sure to agree on a rough timeline to fulfill this plan. Otherwise, they may not prioritize this decision for you. Let them know that you're picking up the development skills and are looking to transition in the next two quarters. Two quarters is a good timeline for your manager to find a replacement resource as well. Option two. Look for freelancing opportunities on platforms like Upwork, Turing, and Topcoder. Or you can tag along with experienced freelancers to get more opportunities. Freelancing is a great way to explore the areas of work that interest you and build a strong development profile. This may even help you transition into a full-time developer role with the client you're working with. And of course, you're going to make more money on the side while learning the tricks of the trade. Third, apply for jobs in smaller companies. Such companies are more open to evaluating candidates for their skills rather than their credentials. If your skills and your experience align with their requirements, they would be ready to hire you. You'd probably earn less than what most developers with five plus years of experience ideally earn. And that's okay. The idea behind applying to smaller companies is that they usually have a smaller salary budget and would be willing to consider you if your skills align with what they are looking for. actually a win-win situation for both of you. So keep your eyes open for such opportunities and when you find it, understand what they are building and how can you add value to their team. When you're about to apply, try this small trick. It could work like magic for you. In the form of demonstrating your portfolio, you can approach the company and let them know that you're ready to implement a project at no cost for a week. If they agree, you have pretty much bagged the offer. And if it doesn't work out, you can always learn from the experience for your next application. The fourth and very useful strategy that you can use is to leverage your domain knowledge. If you have spent a good number of years in insurance, banking, telecom or any other specific domain, use it to your advantage and apply for a developer role in such companies. In some cases, companies may find a particular function of your knowledge attractive and would be willing to give you the opportunity. Last and final strategy applies to you regardless of your years of experience. Apply to as many companies as you can. Even if you're competing with developers with 5 plus years of experience, you can improve your chances by applying to more companies. than them. At the end of the day you just need one or two offers to make the leap in your career. Whichever combination of strategies you plan to use, give yourself a good one-year timeline to make this happen for you. Don't worry too much about your CTC. Focus on getting into a good developer role and within two years you would be easily compensating for the loss. If you're earning around 15 to 20 lakhs per annum in your current role, you most likely would get a similar salary package to start with when you transition. So here's a recap of what you need to do to smoothly transition from a QA to a developer role. Build your portfolio with solid development projects. If you're looking for some interesting and free projects, check out our Cryo Projects Hub. It's a good place to start because every project there is explained from start to finish with a step-by-step plan. You can find a link to the Cryo Projects Hub in the description box. Other than projects, find opportunities to code as much as you can. Then strengthen your DSA and system design skills. And if you don't know where to start with DSA, watch this video to know how you can approach your DSA preparation plan. Apply to as many companies as you can. And if you have over 5 years of experience, do these additional things to prove that you're serious about the transition. Talk to your current manager for an internal transfer. Explore freelance opportunities. Apply to smaller companies. Leverage your domain knowledge. Hope this video has given you enough insights to help with your transition plan.

When I joined Cryo before that, I was really confused because I have almost six and a half year of gap. I was really not sure about whether I can get an opportunity in IT industry or not. But after joining here, I gained lots of experience as well as confidence and also get an opportunity to work as QA engineer. Here I learned 4 Java basic concepts to a DSA. Also, I learned about manual testing, Selenium, TestNG, SQL. Using those concepts, I completed three industry-based projects. Those projects helped us to get noticed by HR recruiter. We can learn so many things as well as we can have some hands-on experience, which is really matter nowadays. doing things are really helpful. After joining here, I learned how to guide programming, how to maintain test scripts and also how to design test cases. I have provided us so many study materials for interview preparation. Those things are really helpful to get some confidence to crack the interview."

        "transcription": "When I was in Bosch I was there for around one year and when I decided to switch it was around six months or so and I was also a bit scared whether it's too late to start now or whether I will be able to switch even if it's after one year will that impact like because I don't have proper development experience. Initially when I joined I just thought that it would be like any other bootcamp programs but after joining cryo like I really like the way that cryo has organized the program so like they would give you some tasks to do and it's not like a typical classroom based training so you you do learn on your own do some research and still if you don't get you know the answers then you go and ask and you have a particular time limit of doing it so that builds up to your you know thinking that okay you need to complete this. within this time frame because there will be more your peers will also be there and they are also doing it and then you get that okay if my friends can do it then even I can do it. Cryo is not much different than actually working in a team. Nobody would teach you the architecture when you you are expected to work on it. You need to figure that out on your own or you need to have that knowledge like beforehand. I went to Geek Trust which was again suggested by Cryo. So there we were asked to build a project. After that from Geek Trust I got two or three companies and one of them was Blackhawk. In my college times I was most focused on problem solving and DS. So usually everyone is focused on that because we think that that is the only thing that could get us through development but that's not the case because there is another aspect of development that is you know learning other's code and that is what we have learned in cryo."

        "transcription": "In Bachelor of Technology, there are various subjects related to computer science, but to be industry ready, we need practical knowledge, and that is why we need to upskill. My name is Aditya Vishwakarma, and I did my graduation in computer science, and currently I'm doing an internship at FXPros. So after doing the internship, they will be giving the offer, full-time offer, like 11th and 12th, when I had computer science subject at that time, and C++ was there, so I started taking interest with this. So I got to know about Cryo from the YouTube. As a first step, I thought, let's prepare with the backend. So I go with the backend developer program. So key learnings was, like, it is project-based learning, so it was a great learning experience. Going through that and also applying it practically was a new challenge. to me. Actually now I'm upskilled with all the skills that are required in the back-end development and I'm doing my internship in back-end development smoothly. So basically what I would say is like have a good connect with a mentor as well as with your peers. It will help you in your journey as well as take initiative in understanding like whatever task or project you have. Take initiative, research about it and it will help."

        "transcription": "I think it's definitely like three four months of really tough time right because nobody was really hiring. I came back to Bangalore, I was just literally applying to hundreds of companies every day. When did you go to your master's? 2006. You graduated? Graduated 2008. Yeah. So 2008 is a great year, right? Fantastic year. I graduated my master's in 2009. Everybody knows about 2008. Yeah. So every time the economy is dull in the US and whatnot, we feel the recession is coming and therefore people feel that, hey doesn't matter how hard I study, I'm going to not get a job because the marketplace is like that, right? We have been to probably three right now. So thoughts? Yeah, I see the sessions. I'm almost dating myself here. See, it's something I tell all the students at Cryo as well, right? For a skilled person, there is no recession, right? Think about the company's perspective. You want to cut down costs, but you don't want to shut down. You want to stay alive as a company, you want to continue producing your products, you want to continue supporting the products you've sold. So who do you want on your team, a lean team, to make sure you can still continue to do all this? Who are those strongest players? Extremely good execution, extremely good skill, very talented. If you can be that person, there's no recession for you, right? So 2008, when I graduated from my master's, I had some experience in India of two years before I went for my master's, right? That kind of helped me when I applied to companies because they're seeing a flurry of resumes, so many freshers graduating from their master's with no real world work experience. you see this one resume, oh this person has actually worked two years, two and a half years. Let's see if we can hire this person. If that doesn't work, then we have the rest of the pool anyway. So that helped. Where did you go to? Postmasters. Postmasters, I joined a startup called Ironport Systems, which was into web and email security, which had recently been acquired by Cisco Systems. But they were still operating independently as a separate entity, doing, today we call it machine learning and all of those things. I was working on it back then when it was not as cool as it is today. But again, see, I had two offers. This was one of the offers I got. The other offer I had was from Motorola. So two offers in a downturn economy. Basically, it comes down to the skills you have and the experience you have and what you can show. good, competent software developer, there is no recession for you. Rachna, thoughts? Yeah, mine was a different story, right? So I did my MBA and graduated in 2009, March, I think that's when like almost the entire world was kind of hiring freeze, right? And I was actually changing from my developer role to post MBA job, right? So I think some of my friends actually went and took developer role also, right? So I was like, I graduated in March, and I was trying to get a job, which is a non developer role, right? Because I did MBA, like whatever, I spent a lot of money and time, I thought I want to get into, I don't want to go back to developer role, right? So I think it's definitely like three, four months of really tough time, right? Because nobody was really hiring, right? Literally no companies, companies like Union Bank of India was coming to campus, so mostly like PS user hiring. I came back to Bangalore, I was just literally applying to hundreds of companies every day. I'll reach out to my college seniors, undergrad seniors, post-grad seniors, everyone in my LinkedIn, so I kind of had LinkedIn. I think they stopped now. If I join a group, they'll allow you to message. I'll message 100 people every day in LinkedIn, so it was really painful for 3-4 months, I would say. The only thing is, I think when markets are kind of bad, I've seen a lot of people talking about economy is bad, it's coming up, going up. We are not economists to predict anything, so we can only do what is in our control. I was very clear, so I'm just going to keep preparing, keep applying, then let's see what happens. And finally after 3 months or so, I got an internship, not a full-time job, I joined as an intern and I kept doing the same thing. Then I think probably I would say June or something, markets started opening up and they started hiring. So I think good thing for me was like I had like, in a week I got some 3 interview calls, my hit ratio was like almost, because I was just waiting for those interviews to happen. I got all offers. I would say when markets are bad, I think you don't try to be an economist and try to predict what will happen, it's not in your control. At the end of the day you need one job. Let's say if India's economy is not growing at 12%, it's growing at 7%, it's not going to impact your career. You just need only one job, you need one person to say yes. So just focus on your preparation and keep at it. I think that's what kind of my learning was. I think that job search was very easy, I was from decent college, I got 2-3 opportunities in campus. this kind of set a tone for the rest of my career, I would say. How to think about job search, what do I need to do. I became very particular about navigating my career, I think from that moment."

        "transcription": "Hey, this is Rathina, co-founder at Career.do. This is Career Cafe. Let's look at today's question. Oh, this is one of the most frequently asked questions whenever I have mentoring hours with our learners. The question is, can I move from non-IT background into IT roles? Specifically, yes, it's possible. There are some factors, especially if you're an early career non-IT professional, graduated within 3-4 years, it's absolutely possible. We have helped a lot of people like that to transform their career into tech. Let me just go through a structured approach, right? How should we think about it? The first question I'll ask is, why do you want to move into an IT role? A lot of times, any career transition will take 9-12 months of effort after 3-6 months of the job search process. And if why is not very, very clear, a lot of times users will actually get derailed. is be very very clear why you want to make this transition. Let's say you're working as a mechanical engineer in a manufacturing industry. Now you think you want to move to IT role. The first question is why you want to move? Is it because you think you can actually do the IT role better? You're very very convinced about, have you spoken to somebody who's already working in IT? Have you understood what is the nature of work? Are you clear this is what you want to do? If this part is clear, then half the battle is won. Second step is how do you prepare for it? Preparation from completely non-programming background into tech jobs will take minimum 9 to 12 months of effort. If you actually take a guidance of platforms like cryo, we'll typically start from helping you to learn programming, helping you to learn problem-solving skills, data searches and algorithms, then help you learn one tech stack. Could be let's say JavaScript or a Java. This process will take anywhere between 9 to 12 months. By end of it we are very very confident if someone is willing to put effort and time, they can be very very capable of full stack or a back-end engineer wherein they have a good confidence on programming, problem-solving, proven portfolio of work. At that point, the third step starts, is the job search process. It can be a daunting task, right? It may take some time, but it's absolutely possible, right? Especially if you're an early career, and typically your non-IT salaries are not very high, right? So you can be considered as an entry-level role for IT jobs, still actually you can get a better salary or a similar salary and move into IT. So as long as you're very, very clear about why you want to move it, you're willing to prepare for nine to 12 months, you're willing to go through a job search process which would take, let's say typically three to six months, it's possible. Talking specifically about job search process, let's say if somebody is a fresher from IT background, when they're applying for a job, let's say out of a hundred jobs, they get shortlisted 10 times, right? You may need to apply for 500 jobs to get the same similar 10 interviews, right? So take more effort, as long as you have right expectations, you're prepared for it, it's definitely worth it. We have seen a lot of people from very different background, right? We have one dentist who actually gone on to become a software engineer, we have people from mechanical engineering background, civil engineering backgrounds and early. career right it's absolutely possible as long as you have these three things clear one you are very very clear about why you want to do it second you're willing to prepare for 9 to 12 months third you're willing to actually put extra efforts and job search process for 3, 6, 9 months so overall in 24 months I'm sure you can actually land in a reasonable place where you can start IT career from there of course your career trajectory will be very very different that's all for today folks if you have more questions leave them in the comments we'll pick them up and put in the questions bowl see you in the next video"

I always wanted to improve myself so I started a Cryo journey just to improve myself to write a good and neat clean code. Before joining Cryo I started developing some projects on my own but that time whenever we start any kind of project I didn't able to think what can I design or what should be the model in the projects. Cryo helps me to think about that and give the idea how the real world projects will be designed, how to think on it, how to write down all the requirements on a paper first, later on you can implement it. Projects help me to stand out my profile whenever I applied for the interviews or job. Every time interviewer ask about the project I'm very confident about explaining all the projects to the interviewer. Learn by doing. my favorite concept. Whenever you got stuck somewhere, they asked to like prepare on your own first and later on, if you didn't get any kind of help, then they will have a live sessions. Before joining the cryo, I'm writing a code like took anything, the function names, any variable names I would take. But later I see the improvements in me. I use meaningful names for the functions and variables. Creating modular components using react is also most helpful by joining the cryo. I understand the modularity of the components and I started writing a neat and plain code. You have to be a consistent to as they guide you, cryo will help you to achieve that goal."

I think the Meta in London has hired a lot of people from India directly, right? And then Amsterdam, Booking.com, if you see almost, I think 60% will be Indians there, right? I think a lot of companies in Germany, right, they're hiring directly from India, right? I've seen some of the friends going to South Korea, right, Coupang, right? And Southeast Asia is another one.

        "transcription": "I had taken a few online courses before Cryo. The structure of these online courses are like, you have video lectures, you watch the video lecture and then you have some exercises to do and you rinse and repeat. At the end you get a certificate. When I first enrolled, I actually didn't have many expectations. I thought it's going to be similar to other courses, but right from the first day, like I was proved wrong. You had to really push yourself. Your hand was not being held. You had to work through the problems that they gave you. So in that way, you know, I was proved wrong. I learned like so many invaluable skills, I would say. Smaller things like, you know, learning how to debug, learning, you know, whenever you're stuck, how do you get past a problem? That's where the, you know, Cryo's methodology helped a lot over there. Things like being comfortable using the terminal. These are things that I use today. Overall, I think- it just made me a much more confident developer. If you want to join the program, then don't come with those expectations that everything will be spoon-fed to you. It is really challenging and you can really get rewarded if and only if you work hard. There's no other excuse for it. So if you like that sort of challenge, then I would really suggest the program. For me, it was really nice. It was something refreshing to really be challenged like that. There were times when even I felt like it's too difficult. I can't do it. But it's just something that you have to push on. You have to think about your goals and what you want to do. It's okay to lose hope in between, but then you have to get up again. Whenever I hit a wall or something during the program, I was like, is that it? Am I going to give up? You know, no, I want to learn. I want to get better. And I was not afraid to ask for help either. You know, whether it's from my friends or the mentors. Because you should never feel ashamed to ask for help. For a program that's supposed to be about figuring things out on your own, the mentors were always there. They took a lot of their time out to organize, you know, sessions for us. They were always open to questions, they were always helpful. All of the interviews, they did ask me about my cryo projects. It enhanced my resume, you can say. Because of the way that we worked through these projects, speaking about them was not so difficult because you did it, you know what you did. So it definitely helped the projects. If you're someone who is really passionate about this field and who loves to, you know, build things, build software, I think you'll really benefit from the program. But you have to be ready to work hard. Cryo has really good programs, explore them, talk to the mentors before you... enroll if you need any kind of information. I wouldn't even call it a course. It was almost like I was doing an internship or something. If you like the challenge, then go for it. But make sure you're really passionate about what you do. I think that's the most important thing. What I learned in cryo, college didn't teach me. Although I had worked on hobby projects before, I hadn't worked on really challenging projects. So I wanted to work on interesting things and I also wanted, you know, better career opportunities. That's what I wanted to get out of cryo and I would say I did get it."

So I was looking for a learn by doing process in which I can learn things and develop a project, which I can show in my resume. In cryo, a good lesson will be that first of all, you are taught and then you have to apply that. In that program, I learned about web development. I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript. We had to build everything on our own. In that, I learned a new tech stack for deployment and developing. I didn't have any experience earlier. So you can see all skills I have for web development. I learned at that time only. The experience which I got, it helped me a lot. If one wants to learn first and then deploy, then the cryo would be best because they have a good programs and modules for different tech stacks. And also if you enroll in them, in the end, they will also get a referral, which is great. That helped me a lot during my internship. All the things developed were discussed in the interview process. It was a good experience for me to learn some web development skills. The best thing would be learned by doing only. first learn, then you have to apply that."

So as a software engineer in Amazon, what is one piece of career advice you would give to junior developers? Okay, for software engineering, I would suggest, you know, be strong with computer science fundamentals. You know, just don't mindlessly go with data access or coding or competitive programming. So along with it, side by side, try to balance software engineering as well, learn the fundamentals, understand the basic principles. If you could have one superpower to help you with your job, what would it be? I don't think there is any supernatural ability that you need. But being able to read a book or study patiently for a few hours, I think that would be, you know, having the patience. And in this age, right, when you have social media influencing you every minute, so having that patience and... know ability to concentrate is I think that should be good. So as a software developer at Amazon how do you manage your work-life balance? Currently my team is pretty chill and we have our senior engineers as well. So in your team it's not like everyone is competing on something so everyone is working together and building something so you don't have a you know toxic environment so in that case in the situation so people are willing to help you so there naturally you feel motivated to work and it's not like you are stressing or anything so that really helps having a good team and good culture within the team is crucial. Final question as a software developer at Amazon what are some practices you do to calm yourself or ground yourself in stressful situations? Typically managers are extremely helpful. In my case managers are extremely helpful when you want to escalate a situation or when you want to you know maybe handle a high severity event. things like that. I play badminton regularly, so I think that's what helps me. Alright man, thank you so much for your time."

At cryo only I learned Java, Spring Boot and the other overmodeling and session solver. That was a big trouble for me initially, but yeah, I have gained confidence and then I was able to do it. At Navi, Java Spring Boot was required. That was quite helpful at the interview process in Navi. Everything is similar. In every language we go, we have to have the motivation to move forward. While in cryo, I always focused on clean food. We are focused on developing step by step. We don't just start solving. First learn the problem and then we check what kind of data structures and algorithm are working on it. We check the edge cases and then we start coding. In my internships, I was appreciated for my clean food. It was quite extensible. So the mentor was quite happy with me. At cryo, everything was built in, but we have to add the features in every industry. still a process. We never start from scratch. You add the features and that's the thing which Cryo held a lot. My friends, the colleagues, the Cryo community, peers which I had, we held each other. Anywhere we stuck, the Cryo committee is there. At present also, I'm in contact with most of the guys there. By the end of this program, I'll be a developer and gain skills which would help me boost my career. Learning by doing is the thing which Cryo introduced.

Usual courses all have these video sessions. I did 2-3 courses before joining CRIO and I didn't really gain much. Here, what was different was that there were no video sessions. There was only material to go through yourself. Then there were some tasks which we have to do. The links provided are filtered. When you go through them, when you read line by line yourself, you gain more than going through those boring lectures. You have those projects that we have to do by ourselves. You have to code every line. You can't find solutions online. So that way you learn more. The projects are really good. Earlier, I didn't have even a single project in my resume. It was empty. But now I have at least 3 projects all from CRIO. Earlier, I didn't have much habit of writing code. I just used to read through the code. When I came to know about Cryo and when I joined it, I really started enjoying to write code. When you write code and when you see that it's actually doing something, like when you see the developed part of it, you get really happy. That's what motivated me till now.

Cryo mentors told me that the functions and the code provided to you in the modules are just like what you will get in a real world. Now when I got the internship, I know that that was true.

        "transcription": "In this problem, we will be discussing binary tree searching. The problem statement is given a binary tree and an integer k, you need to check whether a node with data k is a present in the tree or not. What we have to do is we are given a binary tree that is every node will have at most two children and an integer k value, let's say k is the target value. What we need to do is we need to check find whether the target node is present in the binary tree or not that is we have to search whether the node is present in the binary tree or not. And how is the input going to be given the input and output are being handled by a main method behind the scenes. So you do not need to implement the main method or any input output here. So we are not expected to write the function for main method or to write the code for main method that is the input and output. The inputs are sent as arguments to the function you have to implement. So whatever function we have to implement, we will be having the binary tree as an input parameter and also the target k value as a parameter. What we have to do is we have to implement the function defined in the stub, use the arguments and return the answer based on the return type of the function. We have to return on the basis of whatever the function is expecting us to return. The structure of the tree is given as a reference for you while writing the code. Do not make any modifications to it. So we do not have to change the structure of the binary tree which is given to us and we do not have to change any of the rest of the stub. Otherwise the test cases would fail. So we have to make sure that we are only writing the code which we are allowed to change. Okay. So let's actually try to understand the problem statement using a one example. So the input format will be having some lines n plus three lines of code. The first n. lines. Actually the first line will be containing the number of nodes. So in this sample input we are given six number of nodes. Then the second line contains n space separated integers that is 4 6 minus 2 minus 4 minus 2 plus 2. So these are the nodes in the binary tree and then next n lines will be representing three integers I L R denoting the left child right child of the ith node respectively. So first node having left child 2 right child second child having or second node having left child 4 right child 5 and so on. So in this particular fashion we are going to get a binary tree. This binary tree which we are getting is given in the explanation part also. So this binary tree is given to us as an input and if binary tree is given to as an input we are given the root node of a binary tree. So we are given 4 and we are also given the target k. So k in this case is nothing but 2. So we are given 2 as a target. We need to search whether 2 is present or not. not. If it is present, we have to return true. If it is not present, we have to return false. So in this particular binary tree, is there any node with value 2? Yes, there is one node with value 2. And what is that node? That node is the rightmost node actually, the last node in this entire binary tree. So since node is present, what we have to print? We have to print true in the sample input as a sample output. So this is the first example. Let's discuss some more examples to get the problem statement more clearly. There can be only one node in the binary tree, that is number of nodes can be from greater than zero to less than 1000. It means at least there will be one node or at max there can be 10 is for three nodes less than 10 is for three nodes. Values of the nodes will be from minus 10 is for nine to plus 10 is for nine that is it can be anything in an integer range. Similarly, the target can also be anything from an integer range. So if I take one example, if I take an example as a tree having only one node, a tree. only having one node. Let's say the node data is a 10. The left child is also null. The right child is also null. Obviously, if there is only one node in this case, if I give you the target as a 10, what will be the answer? You will say true because target is present. But in this case, if I am saying the target is let's say 20 is 20 present in this entire binary tree, you will say false. No, it is not present. Why? Because the root node is also not equal to the target 20. Left child does not have any node. It is null. The right child does not have any node. It is also null. So entire binary tree does not have the target node 20. But what will happen for 10? Since root node is equal to 10, root node is equal to k value, the target value, we will return true. So this is the first corner case or you can say the most basic test case where there is only one node. Can there be more than one node? Yes, obviously there can be more than one node. So what if I take three nodes? Let me take three nodes, 10 having left child 20, 10 having right child 30 and then left child. 20 and right child of 20, similarly left child of 30 and right child of 30 will be null. All of these will be null. So if I am taking three nodes, one root node, one left child, one right child, then if I give you a target as either 10 or 20 or 30, what should be the answer? The answer should be true because 10 or 20 or 30 is present. But if I give any other target, maybe 40, maybe 50, any other target, the answer will be false. So now how will you search a target element? So what we can say, if we are present at the root node, what we can say, we are checking whether the root node is equal to the target or not. If not, then maybe the target can be present in the left subtree. If not, the target can be present in the right subtree. So if we are about to search in the entire tree, we have to search in three parts. First is the root node itself. Second part in the entire left subtree, third part in the entire right subtree. So these three parts. We have to search and if in any of the parts our target is found, we can say return true. Otherwise we have to return false. So now that we have covered all the cases which can occur, there can be left child present. There can be right child present. It can also happen. There is no left child. There is no right child. So now the milestone number one is complete. That is, we have understood the problem statement. Now how we can solve this problem actually, how we can search whether a target is present. For this problem, you will be requiring the concepts of tree traversals. So if you do not know how to do tree traversals, maybe using depth first search or maybe using breadth first search. So you have to first get that domain knowledge and then only you can solve this problem. Once you know how to do tree traversals using any of the methods. Now let's discuss one of the dry run or one of the explanation using a test case. So if I am taking a larger tree, a little bit. larger trees. Now that we have taken smaller trees and if I take a target, let's say the target value is maybe you can say 70. So target is 70. Is a 70 present in the entire binary tree or not? I can say 70 is present. Yes, it is present. So it should return true. If I will say the target is maybe 65, is a 65 present? No, 65 is not present. So 65 should say no. 70 should say true, but 75 should say 65 should say false. So how can I search? First of all, if I am following DFS traversal, that is depth first search traversal, if I am using DFS, then what I have to do? I have to first ask to the root node whether it is equal to the target node or not, whether it is equal to the target value K or not. So let's say I am now taking K as a 70. Since 10 is not equal to K, now what should I do? I will be making a recursive call to the left subtree that is there any target node present in the left subtree or not. If it will be, then we are able to search the node. If it's it is not available, then we are about to search in the right subtree. So you can do the DFS in any fashion. You can do the DFS in pre-order traversal. You can do the DFS in in-order traversal. You can do the DFS in post-order traversal. You can even do the BFS. So you can also do the level-order traversal or the breadth-first traversal. It is your wish. Whichever approach you are more comfortable in, you can first code that and then most probably you can have the another approach also. So first of all, target was not equal to the root node. What we are going to search? Left subtree. 20 will also say I am not equal to 70. The target case is 70. So again, search the left subtree. 40 will also say the same thing. There is no tree in the left. That is, the left node is null node. It is a null value. So what should we say? The target is not present. False. Same goes for the right child. The target is not present. answer should be false. Since 40, as well as the left child, as well as the right child does not have target, we should return false. So if entire tree, root, left, right, all the three things are not having the data, return false. Same goes for 20, because left child is not having data, right child is not having data 70, so we will return false. That is false, false, it will be giving me false. What will root node say? There is no target present in the left subtree, it might be there in the right subtree. So let's go to the right subtree. 30, it is not equal to target 70. So what should I do now? Go to the left subtree, there is nothing present. Now finally, as soon as I go to the right subtree, I can say the target is present at the root node. And since target is present, I will return true. 30 will also say what? Since the target is present in my right child, I will say return true. Since 10 will also say that target is present in the right subtree, return true. So overall, I am able to say that target 70 is present. using the pre order or in order or post order traversal that is a depth first search traversal. So now that we know the approach and you can maybe try to figure out the instruction manual on yourself by pausing the video. Now let's try to come up with the instruction manual so that milestone two is complete and now we are jumping on to the milestone number three. So we are given a you can say a recursive function if we are trying to solve it using DFS in this recursive function we are expected to return Boolean that is true or false whether target is present we are given the root node the representing the entire tree and the target that is k. So what we need to do first of all what is the corner case or you can say the base case of this entire tree whenever we are reaching a null node whenever we are reaching a null we can say that target is not present because we should not compare null data with the target if you. are going to compare nulls data with the target, it is going to give you null pointer exception or any other exception. So, since we do not want the exception, since we do not want the error, we have to return false, that target is not present. So, first of all, if root is a null, then return false, that target is not present. Otherwise, if root is not null, then we can compare the data with the target. If root is there, if node is there, so we can compare whether the node's data is equal to the target. So, you can use the val variable. If root's val, if root's val is equal to the target k, so we can say return true, yes, target is present. Because in preorder, what we do, we do three steps. First step, first root node is tagged, then second step, left subtree is tagged, then third step, right subtree is tagged. So, since we are doing preorder traversal, we will be first checking the root node. If root node is not able to give me the target, then I am now going to search for the left subtree. tree by making a recursive call. So I can say if a target is not present, if the recursive call on binary tree searching, if binary tree searching of root's right child, on the root's right child, on root's actually left child first, because we are currently making the left subtree call, is giving me true, is returning true, then we will return true, that is target is found. If the left child or the left subtree is having the target node, overall the tree is also having the target node. If let's suppose the target was 16, since 10 will say the target is present in the left subtree, return true. Since 10 is saying target is present in the right subtree, return true. So if target is present in any of the childs, we can return true. Similarly, I will now check for the right subtree. So whether target is present in the right subtree or not. If binary tree searching, that is the recursive function on root's right child is a returning true is returning true we will say overall we will also return true because we are able to find the target node in our tree if the target is not present in the root neither in the left subtree nor in the right subtree then finally we are going to say return false target is not found target is not found target search unsuccessful target search unsuccessful so this is the last case whether target is not present when the target is not present so now that we have also done the third milestone that is nothing but coming up with the instruction manual let's try to discuss the time complexity of this particular approach so whether we are using a DFS or we are using a BFS even if you are doing is in BFS the time complexity will remain same and the space complexity will also remain same in worst case so what we are actually doing we are traversing on every node we are going to go to each and every node one by one And since we are going to go to each and every node one by one, what is the overall time we are going to take? The number of nodes, because one by one, these nodes will be pushed into the function call stack. So if I try to show you in terms of function call stack, what would have happened? First, 10 would have been pushed, the root node, then 10 would have called the left subtree, so 20 would have been pushed. 20 would have called the left subtree 40, so 40 would have been pushed. And then we have popped 40 because 40 is returning me false. We have now pushed 60 because 60 will be pushed. So what we can say, are we going into the depth of the binary tree? Whenever we are doing depth first traversal, we are traversing the depth. So at max, how many nodes can be there? It can be equal to the number of nodes in a particular depth in a particular branch. So worst case, how many nodes can be there in a particular branch, there can be order of n nodes in a skewed binary tree. So overall time complexity as discussed, it can go linear because it can go to each and every node. Worst case can be target is not present. If we have to search each and every node, it will go linear time complexity. And what about space? Whether you are using DFS, whether you are using BFS, the space complexity will also go linear in worst case due to in recursion, the recursion call stack, because we are using the stack. We are pushing the nodes. We are pushing the root nodes every time when, when we are making a recursive call, or even if you are not using recursion, even if you are doing it using level order BFS, still it will take order of n time due to the queue data structure, because in that you have to use queue in order to store all the levels of a particular binary tree. So it will take linear time, linear space in worst case, that's about the time and space complexity. We will be doing the code of binary tree searching, that is, we will be inline expanding the instruction manual which we have. The recursive function binary tree searching have four major steps. First step was the corner case or the base case. case that whether the target node is, or you can say the current root node is reaching a null node. In that case, what we have to do, we have to basically return false directly. So how we can check whether the root node is equal to null. If root equal to equal to null, so we can say return false because it is the base case, because we should not compare the data of a null node with the target node. Or even if we are not comparing the data, we should not also make the left call and the right call from a null node. If we are standing at a null node, we should not make the left call, we should not make the right call. So first thing is a base case. Next thing, pre-order. Since we are doing pre-order traversal, the BFS, or actually the DFS, that is Depth First Traversal. If root node Z equals to the target, we should return true first of all. First of all, we should compare with the root's data. So how I can compare with the root's data? If root.val, because inside the root node class, there is the property val. So, if root.val is equal to the target data, which is K, we should return true that target is found. So, these are the two corner cases or two standard cases, whether target is not present or whether target is present. So, first case was if the trees were empty. Now there will be two recursive calls. First recursive call should be in the left subtree, then recursive call should be in the right subtree. So, if I basically run this code till this point, obviously it is showing me, going to show me error. Why? Because if none of these if conditions will execute, then I have to return something. So, let's try to write the code for return false. Let's try to return false if the target searches and successful, we are not making the recursive call for now. So, what will happen if I will run the code for the same input, the sample input? If root node will be equal to target, I will say return true. If root node will not, will be equal to target, I will say return false. Why? Because I am only comparing with the root node. So, actually the output we are getting is false, but we have. to get true because currently we are searching for 2 but 2 is not present in the root node. You have to search in the entire tree. So do not we do not have to only and only compare with root node. We have to compare all the nodes in the left subtree all the nodes in the right subtree. So what I can do now if the left subtree is having the answer that is the recursive call binary tree searching on the left subtree root dot left is giving me true if the left subtree is having the target node we will return true that yes target is present. So if I run it again what will happen. Let's see what will happen. It will do what now 4 will make the left call to 6 6 will make the left call to minus 4 minus 4 will call the left to null. And since we are reaching null we will return false return false return false return false target 2 was not present. So we will say return false again but actually answer is true. We should not only call in the left we should also call in the right subtree. Similarly I will make the recursive call that root.write is it having the target k if it is giving me true I will also return true that target is present. Now finally if I will run the code let's see that what is happening. So for the sample input I will be starting from the root node 4 I will be starting from 4 6 is not equal to target minus 4 is not equal to target then minus 2 is also not equal to target 2 minus 2 is not equal to 2 but finally 2 is equal to 2 so return true and overall tree will return true. So this is the case when there is almost 5 to 6 nodes but if there is only one node let's assume there is only one node and let's assume the one node data is 10 and the first node is having the left child minus 1 right child minus 1 that is the left child and right child does not exist we have to give minus 1 if there does not exist. So what will happen if there is only one node what should be the target if I pass the target as 10 what should be the answer answer should be true because root node is equal to target so let's say if the target it is true or not output we are getting is present target is giving me true. But if I give the target as 20, what is the answer is 20 present in only one node tree 20 is not present in that tree. So it should give me false expected answer is false. So let's see. And it is going to give me false. So now that we are okay with the corner cases, when there is only one node or even if there is no nodes. So let's try to submit the code and see if it is going to work for all the bigger test cases. So the code is getting accepted. And let me just bring the code so that we can discuss the time complexity and the space complexity of this approach. This is the particular inline expansion, which we have done from the sample test case. So now that we have completed the fourth milestone, that is the board in expansion that is from the instruction manual. Now we are jumping on to the fifth milestone. else on that is doing the custom test cases dry run and proving the time complexity and proving whether it will work for all test cases or not. So if the root node is null return false, how much is the time complexity constant checking whether it is a base case that is whether it is a null node or not it is constant time complexity. Checking what is the data of root node is it it is also constant checking for all nodes in the left subtree that is making a recursive call in the left subtree it is order of number of nodes in the left subtree same goes for the checking in the right subtree it is order of number of nodes in the right subtree inverse case and finally returning false is constant. So what will be the overall time complexity overall time complexity will be one node for root plus number of nodes in the left plus number of nodes in the right. So overall time complexity will become linear and since we are using recursion call stack space we are going to take linear space also due to recursion stack space getting filled. Because, we are pushing the functions one on the top of other and it can happen for a skewed tree. For a almost linkless kind of tree, the space will be almost linear when there is the height of the tree equal to the number of nodes in the tree. So, that is the time complexity and the space complexity, but are there any optimizations which we can do in this code? See you can try to solve it using BFS traversal that is breadth first traversal level order but still it is going to take same time complexity, similar space complexity. The time complexity cannot be optimized from a binary tree. Later on when you will be learning about binary search tree BST, what you can do is you can try to optimize the time complexity in a BST by either making a left call or making a right call. Like so, currently this is the most optimized time, most optimized space. One follow up question which you can take to solve from your end can be you have to to find the number of nodes in a binary tree which have the multiples of 3 or 5, the nodes which is having the value equal to the multiples of 3 and 5. So you have to first come up with the code of this and then you have to tell me the time and space complexity."

I came to know many new concepts in ReactJS, which I was liking by working on the company projects. The main thing in Cryo platform is you have to solve every problem on yourself. You have to think, you have to find the solutions. When I was working on the projects in Cryo, the blogs they have given in the Cryo is really helpful. By reading the documentation and the blogs will give you a lot of confidence. You can enhance your preparation. By doing those real world projects, you will gain a lot of confidence that you can solve real world problems. How you can logically think about the problem. While doing the project, I came to know about how to write the clean code. After completing two, three projects, Cryo have started interview preparation program that I found really helpful. Cryo will build a portfolio for you. Whatever projects I have done, I have also included in my resume. When I started giving the interviews, I was able to clear the machine coding down.

        "transcription": "Hey Huggers, welcome to a new and exciting series by Cryo.do. In today's video we'll discuss how do we go about creating our very own custom whatsapp sticker pack. Now this is no ordinary sticker pack we're talking about. This sticker pack would have your handwriting overlaid on some image. So the possibilities of making memes and a lot more creative things is infinite. Now while working on this project you will learn a lot about android basics, selenium and linux and a lot more things. If it sounds overwhelming then please do not worry. In the later part of this video we'll have a complete discussion about how do we use these technologies to create this awesome sticker pack. So without much further ado let's get into it. Now this project requires you to know a little bit of python for selenium automation and a little bit of linux or python for scripting. If you do not know that then please do not worry. These prerequisites will be needed only later on. when we choose to automate our project. For now, we should be good. The steps to complete this project along with the relevant links can be found on the CryoProjects Hub page along with many other interesting and fun projects. So starting with the project overview. So to create the custom handwriting stickers, we will have to go through the following steps. The first would be to generate a handwriting like image from text. Then we'll take this image and make the background transparent for this. So after the background is transparent for the handwritten image, we'll overlay it or paste it on another image. Now we'll take this composite image and then we'll use the WhatsApp sticker repo to generate an APK for the new sticker pack. So if I were to scroll down, we can see an example, we'll take this text, we'll pass it through the text to handwriting tool, we'll have this image, then we will make the background transparent for this image, we'll use this cryo frame and overlay our handwriting. text and we'll have this cool sticker. Now we'll take this image and create a WhatsApp APK which can later be installed on our Android phones. And then we can use the stickers as such. Though keep in mind the background can be anything else. Memes. We can make memes. That's what I meant. So now that we have seen the overview and example and how the end product would look like, let's see how do we go about creating our POC. So I'll go to the first milestone which is the prototyping WhatsApp sticker. So the project hub would have this very cool feature which would have these milestones. So it would help us to track our progress and it would help us in knowing what would be the next goal as well. So if we see how do we create the POC, we'll go to the text to handwriting page. Here we'll write our own text and then we'll generate image and then we can download. this image now we need to crop this image to have a proper background size we can get the cryo logo frame from this link so we have our handwriting image and we have our cryo logo now what we need to do is make the background transparent for this image and then overlay this image on our cryo frame now after overlaying whatever image we have we need to create a whatsapp sticker out of it how do we do that so we have a github repository and we need to place our composite images in this folder it needs to be in webp format now we just need to mention whatever new image we have added in this object array and then we can either attach an Android device or use the Android studio emulator to check out the new stickers then we can generate the APK we can install this APK and use it as we please now this process is very manual as of now, right? Because we are creating an image and then erasing the background and then pasting it here and then generating the APK. Now, if we were to automate this, how will we do that, right? So that is the second milestone. In this milestone, we'll use Selenium automation to generate the handwriting image. So we have the links here. How do we get started with Selenium, right? So we have this and the documentation as well. So in the previous step, we automated the handwriting image generation part, right? In this step, we'll do the cropping, erasing of the background and overlaying using command line. All the resources required to do these three steps are listed on the third milestone page. For cropping the image, we'll use the ImageMagick pack. We can install the pack in Linux and then convert the image to the required size. For making the background transparent, we'll use the Padorian library. This is the repository link for the same. And for composition, we can again. employ image magic. Here are a few examples. Now that we have automated the image generation, cropping, overlay and background erasure part we need to integrate all these components which will be done in the fourth milestone. After the fourth milestone is completed we can publish our code to git and make our resume stronger. Now the repositories for the script which are required to do these automations are in the description. Please use them for reference or any help as required. Now that is all the info you need to complete this project. After you have completed this project you will have a deeper understanding of Python, Linux basics and Android basics. Also you will have your very own kick-ass sticker pack with your handwriting on it. And the first three participants who complete this project will get cryo goodies and will be featured in the next video. Also whatever creative sticker or memes you make out of this project please do send them out to us. We really appreciate them. And also the three most creative stickers would get cryo goodies. Doesn't get any better than that, does it? Now before you start working on this project all by yourself, do share this video. I understand working on this project has got you all excited and it would be a lot of fun, but it would be twice as much fun if you were working with your friends. Please let us know what other tech stacks you would like the next projects to be in the comment section. And don't forget to subscribe to our channel so that you're notified whenever we release a new challenge. Do press the bell icon also for that. So I think that's it for this video.

        "transcription": "In this particular video, we will be discussing the problem Binary Tree Pre-Ordered Reversal. What is the problem asking us to do? We will be given a binary tree. What do you mean by given a binary tree? Given a binary tree means given the root of the binary tree, that is the topmost node, the first level node of the binary tree so that we can represent the entire tree. We have to return or you can say print the pre-ordered reversal of its nodes values. All the nodes should be printed in an order known as pre-order. For the tree given, pre-ordered reversal will be for this tree which you can see 1 having left child 2, 1 having right child 3, 2 having left child 4, 2 having right child 5, 4 left child and right child will be null, 5 left child and right child will be null, 3 left 4 5 3 the pre-order traversal so given any kind of binary you should be able to print the pre-order traversal of that specific tree let's read the remaining problem statement we do not have to basically consider the input and output we have to consider it is already handled by the main method and we do not have to implement the main method that is we do not have to implement the input or output the inputs whatever we will get will be part of arguments that is parameters and whatever we have to return you can consider it as a output so return the answer according to the return type of the function that is the number of nodes all the nodes will actually be stored in a list or you can say in an array now the structure of the tree is given as a reference to you it will also already be given you do not have to create a binary tree and the structure is also what you can't change you do not have to modify it you do not have to modify any of the code which is already there otherwise the test cases would fail only and only have to come this function binary tree pre-order traversal so sorry so the input format what will be the input format we will be given some test cases test cases means for different trees or for a single tree there might be a different number of inputs or you can say the different kinds of trees all together can be there also and for each test case we will be containing n that is number of trees so yes each test case represents different tree and in each test case a tree will be given to you using some nomenclature you are using some input format but we do not have to care about it that how actually tree is constructed from this input but once the tree is constructed how will you be able to print a pre-order traversal that is the main thing constraints is the number of test cases can go at max 10 is for 3 the number of nodes in a particular binary tree can go at max of 10 is for 5 and all the nodes in the tree will be having values from 0 till 10 is for 9 Although in the quotient you are given that all the nodes will be having long value in java or you can say in general it is going to be taking 64 bit integral value. So we have to ensure that it is guaranteed that the sum of the nodes number of nodes actually for all test cases will be less than equal to 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 that is 5 into 10 to the power 6 so we do not have to care about test cases or you can say the constraints right now the first thing is what approach should we follow one thing which I say to you will that is prerequisite for this problem was recursion so what we will be doing is we will be solving this problem using recursion only you can solve it using iteration without recursion but using iteration will be a very difficult task at least when we are learning binary trees for the first time so we will stick to recursion for now so let's generate a binary tree let's create a binary tree which will help us to discuss about all the corner case is possible. What can be the corner cases in a particular binary tree? We can have a node with two children at max two children can be there because it is a binary tree. We can also have a node with one child or we can have a node with zero child that is a leaf node. So let's say the root node is having two children. The left child again is having two children. So let me let me make the two children arrows the left child arrow the right child arrow. But what we will do is the right child of the root will only have one single child that will again be the right child. No left child is there or we can say the left child is null in that case null node. And let's do what for this particular node we will say there is both left child as well as right child. There is a left child as well as right child. And for this node for the right child of the left child of root, we will only have a single left child. No right child is there. So we can say for it. right child will be null and for obviously all of these nodes this one this one this one this one we can assume all of these nodes children are both null this is also null this is also null or maybe what we can do is for this node at least we can make both the children that is the left child as well as the right child so yes the tree is a little bit large but i think the traversal will not take that much time so let's just do a try run for this particular tree only let's have the root node with value 10 then 20 then 30 i am giving some random data so that we are able to focus on the traversal and not on the ordering because in binary tree there is no particular ordering of data okay so for this binary tree how will i do the pre-order traversal first of all what is the meaning of pre-order traversal the meaning of pre-order traversal is first before the root before the root node of any tree of any subtree whether the subtree is rooted at 10 between the entire tree or whether the sub tree is rooted at 20 that is this particular tree or the sub tree rooted at 30 that is this particular tree or 50 or 90 for any sub tree or for any tree rooted at any particular node the traversal of pre-order will mean that we have to travel all of its left side nodes that is the nodes in the left children or in the left sub tree before the root node left sub tree for any root node should be visited before the root node then root node should be visited and after root node all the nodes in the right sub tree should be visited all the nodes in the right side that is in the right child but this property should hold true for all the nodes not only for the overall tree node root but all the nodes for 10 for 20 for 40 for 30 every node this property should hold it true so for all nodes of the tree but how we are going to ensure that these three steps or these three you can say these three steps will be required in order to print the pre-order and it will give in the correct answer we can ensure it using recursion recursion will help us in order to make the code concise also and in order to make the ordering according to what we need also that is first what we need we need a pre-order traversal of the entire tree rooted at 10 so let's say the function is pre-order of root from pre-order of root we want the pre-order traversal of left subtree left subtree should also be in pre-order same goes for right subtree it is also a tree with different root so we again need a pre-order traversal but for the right subtree what it means 10 will say what first left subtree give me your pre-order traversal all the nodes in the left child of root 10 then again it will say what it will say 10's right child give all the nodes in the pre-order traversal but in between them I will get printed and actually this is not pre-order this is in order so what will be pre-order pre-order will be the root will be before the left subtree and the right subtree then only the left side and the right side will be there pre-order means three that is before left subtree so a small mistake but we have rectified it before the dry run first root node then left subtree in pre-order then right subtree in pre-order once this is the uh order which we are able to maintain we will be able to maintain the pre-order reversal for the entire tree but actually how are we making ensure that all the left subtree nodes are in pre-order by using a recursive call from pre-order of root we will make a pre-order of root dot left we will make a call to the left subtree of the root node that is to the 20 node and we will say that we are having faith we are having uh you can say a kind of expectation from the function of pre-order of root dot left it will print 20 40 70 80 50 90 in the pre-order area or you can say in the pre-order only same for the right subtree we will call for the pre-order traversal of the root dot right subtree and before both the left sides and the right side sub trees we will print ourselves not in between left and right but before left and right there was some confusion between in pre-order any order but root should be printed for the first time or you can say before any of the children nodes and this property should repeat for all the nodes then the entire recursive function will be recurring for root root dot left root root dot left root dot right right root root dot left root dot right and so on till the leaf node but if i will go to leaf node if we are standing at a leaf node if i will make a further call where will i reach from the leaf node every leaf node is the root i will say yes print the root dot data very good but are we able to go to the left subtree no on left subtree there is null node are we able to go to the right subtree no again right subtree is null node so if somehow we are going to reach on a null node we should not be able to print root.data because null.data does not exist so actually before checking the root.data or before printing roots value we should actually also do what check whether root is null or not so if root is null then we have to just simply say if root is null just simply do not do anything return just simply return from the function then if it is not null print the root call for the left subtree call for the right subtree now let's just do what for the same tree which i have drawn on the left hand side let's just quickly do a try run so starting from the root node what we will be saying first step is the root null no root is not null it is having some data so print the root okay 10 is printed so first output is 10 go to the left subtree so make a call to the left subtree now for this node this nodes function will stop it is paused right now it is not executing because always the function on the top is getting executed because function call stack is there stack means the last and first out the topmost function will always get executed so this function will get executed that is it will also say root is not null print root so i am printing 20 that is in the left subtree print the root node then after root node again make the call to the left subtree for 20 20 will also say after printing myself call for the left subtree for 40 again print myself in the first step second step call for the left subtree for 70 print myself call for the left subtree but as soon as i will call it for the left subtree as you can see it is null so at null we are returning where we will return from where we have called if 70 node is calling null null will return to 70 node itself now what will 70 node do it had made the call to the left subtree already and it has returned from there now it will make a call to the right sub-tree but in this case right sub-tree is also null so both of these calls are just going to be say return so I will return back to 17 node it has done all the three steps first it has printed itself it has made the call to the left it has made the call to the right so since all the three steps are done we will also return because if it is not like if we are going to the last line of the function it is simply meaning that you have to return from that function last line always assumes that you have completed the function and you are just now about to pop the function so I will pop the function and I will go back to the calling function if 40 call to 70 70 will be going back to 40 once we are reaching back to 40 what is the next line going to be executed we have already made the left call now we will be making the right call so same thing for 80 80's first job will be printing itself so print 80 second job will be making the call to the left sub-tree nothing is there third job will be making the call to the right sub-tree the right subtree nothing is there and finally returning to the calling function so 18 do three things first print itself make the call to left return make the call to right return because it is a leaf node now for 40 finally can I say that since we have done all the three jobs printed myself make the call to left make the call to right now is the time to return now is the time to pop from 20 we have made the left call already but now we will be making right call green arrow represents the calling red arrow means returning we are having this kind of nomenclature or this kind of visualization again 50 will say first of all print itself then make the left call 90 print itself make the left call nothing is there make the right call nothing is there return but now see very carefully for 50 is there any right child no right child is null and if right child is null we will also return from here finally from 50 we will also return because all the three steps are done itself was printed, we made the left call, we made the right call and now we will return for 20. Also, all the three steps are done. We printed 20. We printed all the nodes in the subtree of 20 by using recursion. This was the faith. This was the expectation that 20 will print all the nodes in the preorder from the left subtree 407080 from the right subtree 5090. And once all of them are done, we will also return from 20. So what was the expectation by 1010 was expecting that as soon as the preorder is being called on the left subtree, all the nodes in left subtree will get printed and that is what is happening. Similar job will be happening for the right subtree. So let's just do what let's quickly make the call to the right subtrees. So we will call to the right subtree as soon as I'm going to 30 print 13 the preorder or store 13 the preorder traversal make the call to left but there is nothing in the left null just return make the call to right go to 60 print 60 make a call to the left first always left call. then right call and before of both of these calls print itself that's where once we are coming three we are doing three means first the first we have to do what print or travel the first travels 60 then go to left subtree first travels 100 both the subtrees will be null then go to 100 and 10 print both the subtrees will be null and now since both the calls are done we will return since both the calls are done we will return since both the calls are done we will return and this is the entire output this is the tree traversal in pre-order using recursion and the traversal was first root then left subtree then right subtree in in order there will be some other order in post order again there will be some other kind of ordering but let's just do what we have already discussed the approach or you can say the milestone number two is done we will now be writing the pseudocode or the instruction manual but before that what is the time complexity associated with this particular approach see since we are going to each and every node and performing these three steps printing ourself or storing ourself in an array which is to be returned is constant amount of time making a call to left subtree as well as right subtree is also constant it means we are going to each and every node only once we are not going to any node twice or thrice or anything every node is being traveled once but how many nodes are there n nodes are there so in total the time complexity will be order of n since going to each and every node is constant going to n nodes will be order of n linear time complexity what about space since we are making recursive calls we are using recursion recursion means recursion call stack space will be there it means 10 will be pushed into the recursion call stacks inside the call stack let me just make a small call stack 10 will be pushing 20 20 will be pushing 40 40 will be pushing 70 so this is how the recursion call stack will look 70 will pop then 80 will be pulled and so on but in the worst case what is the number of nodes at max which can be there in the call stack whatever is the height of the tree so in general we can say it is order of h but for specific kind of binary trees which you will learn you will learn later on that is a balanced binary tree the height will go minimum you can say log n so in minimum case the space complexity will be logarithmic and the height can go maximum order of n in the case of skewed binary trees skewed means all the nodes are in the right side only or in the left side only only in one side the nodes are there kind of a link list there is a node only right side only left side only left side only left side only right side so kind of a linear kind of data sector link list kind of data sector so in worst case space will also be linear in best case space will be logarithmic for a balanced tree but this is best case it will only be there if the tree is balanced that is it has a least height the minimum height height will be log of n so with that now let's just do what let's just go to the code not the code but the code editor and write the instruction manual first step which we need is store the root node itself into the traversal and for that we are making actually a recursive function so let's just make a recursive function which will do what which will return nothing which will have void return type but we will do what we will pass a root node whatever subtree we want to print in pre-order and also we will pass the list which we want to store in the answer that pre-order traversal will be stored in this list only that is what we are going to return the list okay so this function is a recursive function what is this recursive function going to do recursive function is going to basically take root node and the list as parameters and no return type nothing as a return type void return type function so let me just write in the bracket void return type because we will be just storing the nodes in the list only no need to return anything in the first case what is the first case we have to store ourself the first step is store ourself so store roots data first step is store roots data into the list in the pre-order list after storing the root data make a recursive call to what to the left side make a recursive call to the roots left side And recursive call in the sense we have to make a call to pre-order function free order of two root dot left. Similarly third step will be make a recursive call to the right make a recursive call of pre-order function to the right side to the roots right side but one corner case we discussed that was a base case actually it is known as a base case in recursion which is if somehow root reaches null if somehow we are going to a null node we cannot print the null data we cannot make null dot next or null dot left or right calls in that case what you have to do is we have to return so if before doing anything before printing data we have to check if roots is null itself then we can't do anything just simply return and now what we will be doing is we writing the code from the instruction manual which we have already written and discuss about the corner cases which can be there so first of all from the actual function which was given to us we have to first of all create a list so that we can return all the nodes data in that list we have to return the preorder traversal not just print it so let's name the list as list and we will be making it a list in java to be precise because in java we have a list as acting as a dynamic array you can make it as a link list also but for now we will be making that array list so initially it will be empty it will get filled once we call the preorder recursive function so let's call the pre-order recursive function where we will pass the root node and we will pass the list also that is the answer or you can say pre-order traversal and once it is going to be filled we will return it by just simply saying return list but the one main thing is how we will fill it we will fill it using recursion we will be making recursive calls the first call will be to the right actually to the left tail not the right so we will make a call to the left child bypassing the same list and the second call will be to the right child so pre-order of root dot right and bypassing the same list but before both of these calls pre-order means first we will print the root data before both the calls and if we are first printing data not just print it but actually we have to store it into the list so list dot add roots value roots data we have to add but if i will run this code will this code be correct right now will it not run into infinite recursion or any kind of run time or any kind of stack or exception. Let's see. So it is actually giving me a null pointer exception. The reason is from a null node, if I am going to do null dot next or you can say left null dot right, we will go to a null pointer exception only because null, you can't have a value. You have just null. You can't say null dot anything. So before actually doing all of these three steps, we have to ensure that root is not null. If root is null, we can't do anything. We have to just simply return. That is a base case from recursion. So if root is null, return. After handling the base case also, let's just see if we are able to get the output in the order which we expected. So for the sample dash case, 51436 is working fine. What are the corner gauges before actually submitting? One of the corner case might be if there is no node in the input tree. That is, let's say there is one test case with zero node and if that is a case with zero node, we can  nodes output list should be empty there will be no nodes in the list because it is zero nodes in the tree yes it is working fine why because if root itself is null just simply return empty our list but what if there is only one node and let's say the node is having value 10 and in that case let's say that 10 node is having left child as also minus one minus mean means null according to the input format and right child also minus one it means it is also null so there is only one node with root dot data as 10 in that case the list should also contain 10 so only one node tree should also work fine let's see if it is working fine or not yes it is working fine only one node in the traversal so let's now do what let's now submit the code to see if it will work for all test cases and already it has shown me accepted for 18 test cases and the time complexity as we have discussed in the approach video will be linear why because we will be going to each and every node only once and making these three steps which are are for that node constant in nature but for n nodes it will be order of n and the space complexity since we are using recursion we are making recursion call stack space we are pushing functions in that overall the space complexity will be the height of the binary tree or the depth of the binary tree which will be at least logarithmic or at max linear logarithmic for a balanced tree linear for a skewed tree what is a balanced tree balanced tree is a tree where the number of levels are minimum for seven nodes this will be a balanced tree that is only three levels the minimum levels all the nodes will be add up as possible as much up as well as possible as much as possible but for a skewed tree it will be a tree which is almost linear so this is kind this is example of skewed already one two three four five six seven that is a kind of linear kind of linked list with just either left side or right side for every node so in this case the number of levels or the height of the tree will be logarithmic if you will use some mathematics in this case the number of levels will be n only because at every level there is only one node so in best case it will be logarithmic space in worst case it will be linear space or you can say in general it is order of the height of the tree whatever is height so we have discussed the problem binary tree preorder traversal both the approach as well as the code in two parts what you have to do is you have to code it in your preferred programming language we will meet in a new video where we will discuss a new problem and till then bye bye take care"

        "transcription": "In this video, we are going to learn about HTML elements and tags. And to understand the same, let us now go through one use case. So let us say that you want to display some content on your webpage. Now the question is that browser doesn't have a smarter brain like us, that we can just instruct them and they could just show the same thing on a webpage. That is not practically possible. We need to have a fixed mechanism and a fixed set of steps with the help of which we can build the structure of this webpage so that the content could be shown on the webpage. So the question is how can we mark up the content for our user agents like explaining the content to the browsers or the screen readers etc. so that they can deliver a better experience for the users. So that however the users are expecting the webpage to appear. here, it should just deliver as per their expectation. How exactly can this happen is what we need to find out. Now that is definitely possible with the help of HTML elements and tags. Let us now try to understand how exactly they are going to help us for the same. So everything in HTML is made up of elements. So HTML is used for building up the structure of a webpage, right? So we are going to write the complete structure of this webpage in terms of elements. Every single part of a webpage is going to be built up with the help of elements. Now what is an element in HTML? Well it is a bundle together of starting tag, content and the ending tag. You can just imagine it in this way that a bottle is containing some water within it. So this starting tag and ending tag will be the container in which you can keep some content into it. any type of a content, whether it is a text, whether it is an image, whether is it a link, all of these kinds of contents are going to be stored in a tag. And a tag will have some kind of a starting as well as some kind of an ending. And this is the syntax for writing those kinds of tags. This is how you start a tag. This is how you end a tag, by just adding a forward slash before writing the name of the tag. Now, what is a tag in HTML? It tells the browser the type of the content in that element, whether the content is an image, whether it's an input element, whether it's a button element, or whether it's just a normal text element. So tag is basically going to be that element which instructs the browser that whatever is going to be inside me is going to be this kind of a content. Take image tag for an example. We denote it by img. Now, if you're going to write an image inside this tag, it is going to render as an image. the browser. How do you think this must be possible to happen? Because IMG as a tag instructs the browser that whatever content is inside me has to be rendered as an image. So this is exactly how logically the system of elements and tags are supposed to work. Now what is a starting tag? As I've told you, this is how you write your starting tag and this is how you write your ending tag. So whatever tags you want to start and end, you have to give the name of those tags in angular brackets and while you're ending it, you just have to add a forward slash before your tag name. Now there are a bunch of tags available in HTML. Some of them are mandatory to write in your HTML file, some of them are optional as well. So let us now try to see the same with the help of an example on code sandbox. So let's visit code sandbox and this is a sample HTML file that we have prepared, index.html. Now let me just add a sample tag so that you can understand it better. So for writing a heading, I can say an h1 tag. You can just take it as an example for now. So I have started the h1 tag, I have ended the h1 tag. And now in between this starting and ending tag, I can write some content. Let's say I want to say this is a heading. If I hit a control plus s, this file will be saved and it will be rendered over here. So can you see it is coming in bold letters like a heading. So whatever content you wrote in this h1 tag is simply going to be rendered accordingly on the web page. Let me write one more tag. This time let me use a paragraph tag, we denote it with P. The tag name for paragraph is P. I can say this is a paragraph below the heading. If I again hit a control plus s, you can see this comes in a smaller font size because paragraphs are ideally going to be written in a smaller font size compared to a heading. So can you see this is how with the help of several tags available in HTML, you're going to build the basic structure of your web page about where should your heading appear, where should the remaining of the content appear, where your buttons should appear and so on and so on. So this is how the systems of elements and tags help us in building the structure of HTML web page."

        "transcription": "Hi all, now we will try to understand what is replit and why we will be using replit throughout our journey. So replit is an online tool which will help us to write the Java programs. Not only Java program, you can use it for any other programming languages also. So let's try to understand exactly what will be the purpose of replit. Let's open this link. Once you will click on this link, you will notice that a code base has already opened up for you. So let's have a look at this code base. So if you will notice, there are some files present over here. For example, there is a main file which is present and we have a code base over here. So replit is actually an online tool. where you can write your Java program and execute it. So you are not required to install all those Java JDK, JRE on your local machine, and even any IDE, like IntelliJ or Eclipse. That will not be required. We will use this online tool to write our program and run it. We will use this online tool. And second scenario for which we will use, so let's say there is a code base which is already present. So that code base will be shared to all of you using this replit link itself. So if you would notice, we are already shared with some code, right? For example, this main.java. Then there is MD file present. That is logicaloperator.md. So these files are shared to you from Cryo side. And we will do some enhancement on modification on top of these files itself. So that is why we will go ahead throughout our journey on replit itself. A link will be shared to you. And we will write our program using that itself. Now in order to go ahead and use replit, you will be required to create an account. So just log into replit.com just log into replit.com and after that you can sign in with your gmail use the same gmail ID with which you have registered at cryo and you can just create a sign in once you have created a sign in you can open this link. After that, there is an option to poke a ripple. So if you would notice as of now, this program is shared to us from cryo side in the browser also it is written as cryo tools. It means that you don't have permission to edit this file. If you would notice I'm not allowed to edit this file. So you will create your own local copy. So this is the common code. This is a common code which is shared with all of us. We will create our local copy from this. All of us will create our own local. copy and you can perform changes on top of that. So in order to create a local copy, you have to click on this fork option. Just click on this fork option and you will have one more option to fork ripple. Just click on this fork ripple. Now, if everyone would notice it has replaced that cryo tools with my name. So it means that it has created a local copy for me. And if you guys would notice I am allowed to edit this file now, I can make some changes. For example, let's try to print something. Let's say I want to print a plus B. Let's try to print this and run our program. So it has given me permission to edit the file and I've added some extra piece of code. So the code base which was shared to us from cryo side have made some enhancement on top of it and I'm able to execute my program as well. So that will be the overall uses of replit as a tool throughout our journey."

Two years ago, my work was to prepare an Excel sheet and send it out to the tech lead. That's it. You don't need any technical skills to do that. That's when I realized that two years have been wasted like this one, no technical skill, nothing like this kinds of work, anyone can do that. So there is no point in doing that. At that time, I didn't even know how to start. I wasted around four to five months for certifications. Had it been like I met Cryo in the very beginning before going off the certification, so probably five to six months would have been saved. Cryo taught me everything, right? My learning curve kind of skyrocketed. You need to think of the architecture. What is the best possible scenario? How do you design a system? There's a lot of things to consider. Basically, I'm able to do everything right from the start till the very end. Cryo gave some extra efforts in making up your resume also. I would like to call Cryo as one of the best decisions and investments that I have made in my life. Some Excel sheet work to being a STE-1 today. Basically, I can do most of the things. Development, deployment, everything. So, I could confidently say that without Cryo, I couldn't have done that."

And you were a software developer yourself, right? So, now do you think that it's going to be so integrated that software developers need to learn about AI even to try it? Absolutely. It's being taught in schools as curriculum. But I feel like you can still make a career without it as well, right? I mean, yeah. Okay, that's what you're asking. Yeah. So, yeah. So, I, just to put on that, it's definitely necessary. But I still think you can be an engineer who have never got into the ML pipelines and stuff. You can still work on apps, build websites. Obviously, you need to know about data. But data is one layer of the whole architecture. There is so much of the different layers when it comes to the app. So, it's good to know about it. be very interested need not be an expert yeah because so when when Purnima says it's an AI first it's the vision of the how the world is going and it's not even a vision it's the way even if the product is AI first the person who codes the product having an understanding of what that AI first delivers will enable them to build a product in that way right so yeah you need to be cognitive about it you you need not be like an expert in that field see it's like a correlation I would draw to what database was in our times right so you are a developer you don't have to be a database administrator but you should know how to use it got it if you don't know it's going to be troublesome right so that's the way it's going to be someone has built a model you should know how to use it"

I would say don't wait until you're completely prepared, okay? Just keep applying and you never know when you might get selected. If you keep waiting that start giving interviews or I'll start writing my resume only after I complete my preparation, then it'll take too much of your time. So suppose if your target is six months, it may end up even going beyond a year. So make sure that you're simultaneously learning and applying as well so that consider your interviews as your mock interviews. So which will help your future interviews. So that's kind of one thing. I'll add on one thing. In case you feel like you're not prepared, go for the lighter companies like not the bigger ones so that you can have a preparation round and then probably you can go for the bigger ones. I go for similar packages so that you have an idea. That's one thing that you can do but you are never prepared. Trust me, no one is never prepared. I think having one offer at hand gives you a lot of confidence. It does."

        "transcription": "I was a manual tester for two years. I was not writing any kind of code. I don't have any knowledge on programming, any programming language, but suddenly coming into this course where I was being taught with the programming language, the main plus point, there would have been a hurdle from other, if I would have taken from some other coaching centers, they would have started with the topic. I'm from Tirupati. I worked as a manual tester for two years in a software company, but after working for two years, when I thought for a job change, there was a lot of competition in the market and only manual testing is not enough to survive in this tough competition market. So then I thought of taking course from Trio because they are offering me with some good projects. It's not like that. If you just join a course with the main agenda of getting a job, then you can't get a hundred percent of knowledge from the course and everyone's agenda should be first, you should understand. every concept clearly and detail. Here, TRIO helped me to be strong on my basics. They have taught me how we will teach to a fifth or sixth class kid. That was main plus point to me. The mentors are, they're like highly experienced professionals. Whoever mentor you have been allocated with, they're highly experienced professionals. And everyone will be too supportive coming to mentors or doubt resolution sessions or they are too good in helping you. So one thing I could say, if you do the project or if you complete the assignments, you should do it very constantly. If you are spending two to three hours, it should be constant spending of your time. Ask thousand questions, whatever the doubt, it may be silly doubt or it may be serious doubt. TRIO is there to help. If you raise a doubt, TRIO technical expert will 100% he will try to make, solve that doubt by yourself only. He will give you the hints. which you can solve the doubts this will improve your logical thinking he will try to get the answer from your motor so keep that in mind and the main thing is they have their dedicated websites you can definitely do everything in that single website that's it that is the main plus point just you have to have a laptop that's it it's more than enough so don't think that you are spending some money on the course you are investing on your future"

If you do something on your own, you might lose that enthusiasm. I needed something to push me. That motivating drive that I got from Cryo, that was new here. So Cryo made me consistent in that way. The thing that I like most about the Cryo modules was they didn't let me skip anything. If I was doing this on my own, I would have given up. But Cryo helps and it was very good. You get any doubt and they would reply to you within a day or two. I was comfortable with development part. Like I had read many frameworks, worked on them, but wasn't very confident because I used to get stuck. Modules are structured that way, they also provide hints. And hints are structured like to let you know only the limited part. So you can figure out most of the things on your own. That also gives you confidence. The way I progressed in Cryo and its modules, it boosted my confidence and also in the interviews, when an interview would come up, I could confidently say that I, yes, I have worked on it. Also, like when I was working in my company as well, I completed any task that was given to me. So it helped me in company work as well and in the interview as well. Because of its learn by doing methodology, it makes sure that anything that a person is going to learn is going to learn it 100%. I would say that why should we try Cryo? Because of the structured way of its content. You get the real interaction with the tutors. You can talk face to face to your tutors. You get your doubts resolved. That's what we need while we are learning. There is so much content while you are in Cryo. There are blogs. It's not just this is our content and you will get all that much. They are helping us to become better engineers. So that's the effort that we can count on."

Or you're not earning enough, but at the same time, you're struggling to take the time out to upskill for your next job? Well, of course, you're going to have to refresh your skills to take on a better role. But time should be the last thing coming in your way. Hi, I'm Ritwik. And if you're stuck in the vicious cycle with your work and want to learn how you can manage upskilling for a new job while working a full time job, then watch this video till the end. And if you're new to the channel and haven't yet subscribed, do it straight away so you don't miss out on any practical strategies and actionable tips to take your tech career to new heights. Everyone enjoys staying in a comfort zone, your daily routine, the people you interact with and the types of challenges you take on at work. How do you problem solve them? You pick and choose these activities that fit within your comfort zone. Am I right? But setting into your comfort zone this way can strip you of new opportunities. opportunities to grow and excel in your life. And this holds good for your career as well. If you have realized that you are in your comfort zone and want to get out of it, the first step is to understand why do you want to get out of it. In this case, ask yourself, why do you want to upscale yourself? Why is it important to you? Is it because you want to move to a better career? Do you want to increase your salary? Or is your current work just plain boring? Whatever the reason is, on a scale of 1 to 10, how strongly do you feel it? Based on your answer, you will know how much of an effort you are going to put into this. If you feel a strong 8, 9, or 10, I am guessing you are willing to do whatever it takes to upscale yourself for a better job opportunity. If it is anything less than 7, I can tell you that eventually you will get into distractions like movies, games, going out with friends, and whatever else to stay in your comfort zone. So, before we move ahead, think again to yourself and decide how serious are you about upscaling yourself. And I will show you how you can do it while managing your full-time job. No matter why you want to upscale, you are going to need a plan before you begin this journey. So, your focus is, put together a short-term plan to achieve your upscaling objectives. If you stick around till the end, you will find out the importance of design. a short-term plan rather than a long-term six-month or one-year journey. Once you have that ready, let's look at how you can execute it by managing your main challenges. Now that you have decided why you want to upskill and how badly you want to do it, let's look at two major challenges you need to tackle to complete your upskilling journey. Well, I know I promised to share a plan on how you can manage your time well, but along with time, another key factor is motivation. Managing both well will become the key to your success. If you agree, hit that thumbs up and let's look at each factor one by one. Challenge one, managing your time. To tackle your problem with time, let's first understand how long you spend working on your full-time job. If you spend less than eight hours at your work, it's fairly simple for you to manage upskilling on the side. All you have to do is analyze how you are currently utilizing your time and plug gaps to spend about 15 hours a week to upskill yourself. That's right, 15 hours a week for the next four to six months is all you need to upskill and change your job. If you spend more than eight hours a day at work and aren't sure how you're going to manage 15 hours a week for upskilling yourself, don't worry. The following parts are just for you. Are you traveling to and from your work every day? You can create time by finding ways to reduce your commute time. The ideal amount of time would be to spend 30 minutes or less, both ways. If you're spending more than that, you need to rethink this for yourself. First of all, traveling for one or more hours every day can be super exhausting. And by the time you reach home, more often than not, you'll be exhausted to spend energy on learning new things. The process can turn out to be tougher for you after a couple of weeks because you will struggle to show up with a focused and fresh mind. So what can you do to fix this? If you're in the early years of your career, you won't have the added responsibility of a spouse or kids. You have the flexibility to choose where you live. Leverage this and find a place closer to your office. This may seem like a tedious task, but think about the hours of traffic and exhaustion. It can save you in the long run. In the worst case scenario, if you can't avoid the commute, try getting as much rest as possible during your commute time. The second thing you can do is create more time for yourself by optimizing your current task. Identify some things that you do at work which can be done faster and in more efficient ways. Like, write macros in Excel instead of manually repeating tasks. Get better at debugging so that you're done. skill increases as well. Write simple shell or python scripts to automate your tasks. Initially, you may have to put in some extra effort at figuring out faster ways to get things done, but it's going to save you a lot of time in the long run and that extra time can be put into your learning. Next and the most important thing for you to effectively utilize your time is to compartmentalize your day. Actively block time in your calendar that is dedicated to your upskilling. It could be in the morning or evening and whenever you think your focus is high and you can stick to the routine every day. I've seen that many people tend to take time out for themselves when others are sleeping. Like around 6 to 8 in the morning before their roommate wakes up or 10 to 12 in the night after their family or friends are asleep. Whatever time slot you pick, the rule of thumb is that you should be able to follow it consistently for at least 80% of the time. By blocking time, you're clearly compartmentalizing your office work and personal upskilling and this will help you progress towards your goal in a consistent way. A small tip here. Treat these blocks of time with the same importance as your office meetings. Don't miss them unless you have a genuine reason. Now, let's be practical. Week on week, month on month, it's very hard to stick to a daily routine. Things come up at work or at home. at home that will result in you missing your routine. But this shouldn't be a reason for you to drop your upskilling journey. What you can do instead is plan periodically for high-intensity catch-up weeks, like a weekend marathon to catch up with your pending goals. Have you ever done one of these marathons before? The satisfaction you get at the end of it is truly awesome. You'll agree if you have done this before. Say you switch on your high-focus mode on a Friday evening and go on with it till Sunday noon. It feels awesome to have a productive weekend and then treating yourself that evening by doing something you like. It sure feels like you earned it. Let me ask you, which one of these would you prefer more? Finishing a set of tasks in the week or spending about 10 hours in the week. The first one is a task-based goal, whereas the second one is a time-based goal. When you're planning your weekly goals, it's going to be useful to understand the nuance between time-based goals versus task-based goals. For example, you work every day between 9 to 5 pm. This is a time-based goal for your work. Whereas in your weekly meetings with your team, you'll discuss certain tasks and set clear goals on what you would like to complete by the week. These are task-based goals. Both work in tandem. You can use your time-based goals to guide you finish your task-based goals. Your ultimate goal should be to... knock off tasks and not the amount of time spent. Who doesn't like to tick off to-do lists, right? The last and the final way to maximize your time and productivity is to take enough breaks. Doing your office work and upskilling on the side on a week-on-week basis can be quite taxing. This is why it's even more important for you to prioritize and plan your breaks. If you skip taking breaks, you'll head towards mental exhaustion and you'll find yourself asking existential questions. While it is normal to feel that way sometimes, we don't want you to get there. You have to be able to manage between pushing yourself far without breaking yourself. In other words, you need to avoid burnouts. Different people have different mileage for this journey and planning your breaks in advance will help you get to the finish point. You don't want to wake up on a Saturday and not know what to do and waste the day. You'll end up neither upskilling nor feeling relaxed. So, plan your breaks in advance and work towards completing your goals and earn those breaks. This will help you set realistic goals and you will be motivated to continue when you complete a milestone in your plan. For example, you can plan a trip in advance with your friends to go after completing an important milestone in your upskilling plan. Personally, I prefer taking 2 full days of a month to clear my mind and start off. And by two days off, I don't mean the regular breaks you take between work and studying. I mean complete time off from computer screens for that time. So far, we have looked at six different strategies to manage your time well. If you have more tips that you adopt for yourself, let us know in the comments below. And before we move on to the next part where we tackle challenges like staying motivated, let us know if you're liking the video by hitting that thumbs up. Let's admit, upskilling is harder not because you have to put in the effort, but because you have to put in the effort over a period of time. Simply said, it's a marathon, not a sprint. How do you sustain this over a long period of time? Let's look at some ways that can help you stay motivated throughout the process. Find a buddy who you can pair up with and prepare together. When you share your upskilling goals with someone, it helps each of you to stay accountable to the process and both of you can push each other to stay on track. Who knows, someone watching this video could become your buddy during this journey. Reach out in the comments and find a buddy with whom you can share this journey. Another important thing that people miss out on doing is celebrating achievements during your journey. It could be a small goal or a big milestone you have crossed in your plan. Before moving on to the next milestone, take a moment to celebrate it. yourself with an ice cream or go out with your friends. Whatever you enjoy doing, do that to acknowledge how far you have come at every stage of your learning journey. When you do this regularly, you will automatically start associating incentives with your weekly goals and that will in turn push you towards accomplishing your goals. So the next time you take off a task from your list, don't forget to celebrate that victory. When setting your goals and creating your upscaling plan, think in terms of short intervals. If you think of working for the next six months with the same intensity and rigor week on week, it could seem overwhelming and you may never start your plan. Instead take one to two months at a time and only plan on pushing yourself hard for those months. Have you ever thought about how you start through eight hours of class for 12 years in your school? Quite a phenomenal achievement when I think about it for myself and if I rewind and think about it, I realize that I have never thought about it as a 12-year plan. My only goal was to get through with my tests and quarterlies, half yearlies, final semester and all I cared about was the holiday break after each exam. This kept me going year after year and this is how all of us think. It's easier to stick to a long-term plan if you are focusing on short-term goals. the next immediate big target is. And at last, when you start attending interviews in the later part of your upscaling journey, the taste of success at the end of the interviews will take over and become your primary motivation to get through the process. So, you can expect that the longer you push through in this journey, the easier it gets to stay motivated in the later parts of your journey. And that brings us to the end of this video. If you found these tips and strategies useful, share it with your friends who need to watch this. And do come back after a few weeks after trying these methods so that you can let us know how these worked out for you. If you're building your career in the software industry, stay tuned for more practical tips and industry insights that will help you take your career to new heights. \u266a\u266a\u266a"

So I wanted to gain that confidence. I thought that Cryo gives the micro experiences, which is really helpful. It basically makes the, how the work happens in the real world. So the program was constructed in such a way that all the stuff was already provided beforehand, and we didn't have to look at any other resources. In the initial modules, they actually gave the test cases, which actually test the code quality of your project. That ensured that I'm learning the healthy practices for writing the good code. The whole learning journey was all about learning by doing. I was continuously learning and implementing, rather than watching tutorials and going through lots of resources, which was not really needed. So it saved a lot of time for me. That really was a game changer. If you are a newbie, if you haven't done any development, even if you are a developer, I would really suggest to go through it because it really developed the. the confidence that one lacks when we don't have the real world experience."

        "transcription": "In this video, we are going to get introduced to what is HTML, what is a webpage built off and what all elements can we see in a webpage. So to understand all of these things, let us first of all take up a use case of how exactly and what exactly is a webpage built off. So as you can see the Google's webpage currently in front of you. So what exactly this webpage must be built off, there must be something which must be going behind the scenes so that this webpage is rendering on the browser, right? So we need to understand that what is a webpage going to be built off. Before we even discuss that, let us try to understand it from a real world perspective. Now what is the very first step that you take when you're going to construct a new home for yourself? You're going to prepare the structure of that home first of all, right? Similarly, you will need to create the structure of a webpage as well. well before you start doing any styling or the other aspects to it. So the structure is the first and foremost thing that you're going to get started within a web page. So what is a web page going to be built off is something which is going to be taken care by HTML. Very shortly, we are going to understand what is HTML. Before that, let us also try to understand what all things can you see on a web page? What all elements can you see on a web page? So if you carefully focus on the Google's homepage, what exactly are the elements that are available over here? Well, you can see certain images like this Google's brand logo. You can see your Google accounts profile picture over here. You could also see certain links like Gmail or Google images or Google search or all these different languages links. Now whenever you click on one particular link, you're going to be redirected to some another web page. What else is available? We have a search input. So if you type in something over here and click on enter accordingly, the results would be displayed on a separate URL Similarly, what else is there? We also have some buttons available If you click on this particular button, there will be a pop-up opening up If you click on this particular button, you will be redirected to some other page So different buttons on a single web page might have different functionalities associated with that So this is exactly what we need to take care of Now what all elements can be present on a web page? Mostly the things like these Maybe we can have some images, links, inputs and buttons and each of them might have their own set of functionality associated with them Now a button can be used for a particular function and another button on the same page can be used for some other functionality The best example would be the same Google's homepage Clicking on the Google search button, taking you to another URL, but clicking on this icon simply just opens up a pop-up up. So two separate things on a same page with different functionalities. So these are the general kind of elements you will be able to see on any type of a web page. Now, how exactly do you build such pages? You're going to do that with the help of HTML. So HTML stands for hypertext markup language. Now it is going to be the standard markup language for creating your web pages. So as I've told you, for creating the basic structure of your web page, you're going to make use of HTML. Now it is responsible for the structure of your website about, let us say you want to have a particular section on the left side of your web page and another section on the right side of the web page. So all these kind of basic structures about which particular element has to be placed at which side is something you're going to build with the help of a structure. Now it's going to be made up of different set of elements, which is going to tell the browser what and how to display these elements. So if you want that icon to appear on the top right corner, if you want you know a brand logo to appear on the middle of your web page, all of those things, the placement of them is something which can be handled easily with the help of structuring. And structuring in web development is done with the help of HTML. So it contains all the information like the structures, what all elements it contains, all the content that is going to go under that particular section, what are the styles associated with it, what are the different set of fonts we want to use for showing different set of content. So these are all the things which are handled by HTML. So if we again go to Google's web page over here, so as you can see in this page what exactly can we observe, we have a different set of elements. So here we have this particular image, we have a link, we have an icon on click of which this kind of a pop-up opens up. If I click on this sign in button, I might be redirected to some other page. If I click on the mic button, something else might pop up, right? If I click on this button, something else might open up, right? So if I type in Google Drive and I click on enter, did you notice we are redirecting to some kind of an another page? So this is exactly how different elements can perform different set of functionalities on a web page. And the structure of them is going to be handled by HTML. So this is exactly how HTML works."

        "transcription": "In this video, we are going to learn about expressions and to understand expressions. Let's try to understand one use case. So here you have a question in front of you, console.log of 2 plus 2. Now can you guess what is going to be the answer for the same? Well, most of you must have guessed it correctly. This is going to be 4. So as we believe, we are going to ask JavaScript what is 2 plus 2 and as a reply on the output, JavaScript is replying back with an answer of 4. Sounds simple, right? But what is the observation that we have to make over here? That it is not printing 2 plus 2 directly on the output. It is actually printing the answer of 2 plus 2 which is 4. What does it mean? That JavaScript is capable enough to answer mathematical operations expressions, right? So what can we say about expressions? That expressions are always going to result in a single value. And these are the questions that JavaScript are capable enough to answer. Think about any complex mathematical expression. It is always going to result in a single value. And this is something that JavaScript can easily evaluate and then answer, right? So to perform more arithmetic operations on these kind of values, what do we need to use? Well, of course, we are going to make use of mathematical operators for the same, right? So what all mathematical operators do we have available in JavaScript? We have brackets, we have addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder. We also call it as a modulus operator. And eventually, we need to have a set of precedence order for them as well. But why do we need this precedence order? Let us try to make an example for the same. So let's go back to REPLIT. And let me make a random example for us. Let's say console.log of 2 plus 3. into 4 then divided by 5% 6 divided by 7 into 99 now have a careful look over here if you're going to evaluate this by yourself without using any calculator you must be using a modulus operator before using the division operator or in some other random case you would like to do this 7 into 99 first and then eventually divide the whole thing by 6 right so which is the correct thing which operator has to be executed before which one so we need to have a set for rules of the same so we call that rule as precedence rule in JavaScript for precedence management we have a rule which is known as baud mass rule now baud mass rule is something you must have studied in your basic mathematics as well so it is the same rule which is going to be followed over here as well so right now if I try to execute this this by writing the command node space expressions.js, you can see the answer is coming out as 35.94. Does it change every time I execute this result? Of course not, because JavaScript is working on a specific set of rules according to which it prioritizes which operator has to be executed first and what is this rule and how do we understand that? Let us try to see that now. So the precedence rule simply tells you the priority on which the brackets have to be resolved or any kind of operator have to be resolved. So brackets over here is the highest set of priority. After that comes division, multiplication and remainder. Remainder basically the modulus operator. Finally comes the addition and subtraction. So we simply call this rule as a board mass rule just to remember the order of precedence. Okay, so the brackets come first, then the division, multiplication and remainder. Finally comes the addition and subtraction. But you must be able to notice that some of these characters are written in a single line. Now why exactly is that it is because division multiplication and remainder belong to the same level of priority right now again you must be thinking then whenever we have to decide between division and multiplication which operator we will be choosing first well that is going to be division so the rule that you have to remember is the precedence level is going to be followed according to the board muscle and whenever you have to decide between the same categories you have to go from left to right it clearly means division is having a higher priority than multiplication multiplication is having a higher priority than remainder and that's how it goes so as you can see in case they belong to the same category follow the order from left to right alright so let us quickly do a demo of evaluating these expressions as well so I would recommend you all to pause this video now and try it some of these on your own as well. All right. All right. So now let us continue and try to solve all of these questions one by one. Okay. So I'm going back to repel it and let's comment this one and I can say console dot log of two plus two and all of us already know this one. This comes out to be four. Right. So let's do this quick and let's try to do all of them one by one. So what is going to be a console dot log of five into 15? Well, let's execute all of them one by one over here. Five into 15 that is going to be 75. We are shortly going to check the answers as well. The next one is 10% 2. So percent over here is known as a modulus operator. And what does modulus stands for? It simply gives you the remainder when you divide the first number by second. So for an example, if you're going to divide 10 by two, what is going to be the remainder left? Well, in this case, it's going to to be a 0. Next one is console.log of 19 minus 29. So let's do that 19 minus 29. Next one is console.log of java plus script java plus script console.log of js divided by 4. Well this seems to be weird right? We are trying to divide a string by a number. Can you guess what is going to be the answer? Think about it. Next one is 3 plus 10 into 2. Finally the last one that is console.log of 3 into I think that's going to be a 3 plus 10 into 2. Alright let's make that up. 10 into 2. Alright, so before we execute all of them, let's try to solve it on our own as well. So the first one we already know is going to be 4. The next one is again a simple multiplication. This is going to be 75. 10% 2 as I've already explained is going to be 0 because when we divide 10 by 2 the remainder is going to be 0. When I do a 19 minus 29, again it's a simple subtraction. The answer is going to be minus 10. When we do a concatenation of two strings using a plus operator, it simply gets merged. So this becomes Java script. Please remember that there is going to be no space between both of them since we are simply concatenating the two strings as it is. Now the next one seems to be interesting. We are trying to divide a string JS by a number which is 4. Now in this case what is the answer we are going to get? Let's execute and check first of all. So if I execute this, I'm able to see an answer known as Nan stands for N A N. Now what is the full form of Nan? Nan stands for not a number. So it is a special number available in JavaScript, which is simply used to denote all the invalid mathematical operations in JavaScript. As you can see on line number eight, currently we are trying to perform a mathematical operation using divide operator, but this kind of a division of a string by a number is totally invalid. So for all invalid mathematical operations, we can say Nan is the answer we are going to get. So Nan is a special number which simply denotes all the invalid mathematical operations. What is going to be the next one? Three plus ten into two. Well, this is going to come out as 23, which is the operator which got executed first. Well, that was multiplication. Why? Because of the baud mass rule. According to the baud mass rule, multiplication has a higher priority than the addition. So 10 into 2 becomes 20, 20 plus 3 becomes 23. Finally comes the last one. Since the brackets have the highest level of priority, so whatever is there in the inner bracket is going to be resolved first. So 3 plus 10 becomes 13, 13 into 2 becomes 26 and that's how you have got the answer 26. So this is how we evaluate our mathematical expressions and JavaScript is capable enough to answer these kind of expressions into a single value. Interestingly, what is going to be the data type of this value NAN? Let us also try to print that console dot log of type of NAN. Let us print the answer and interestingly, this is going to be a number. Well, the full form says not a number. but the type of says it's a number. So that is the reason when I gave you the definition of Nan, I clearly stated that Nan is a special number available in JavaScript, which is used to denote all the invalid mathematical operations in JavaScript. So please remember, you don't have to be confused between the definition and the data type, right? Nan as a value is simply standing up for not a number, but its data type is clearly a number itself. All right, then. Now, how do we evaluate our variables with the help of expressions? So let us say we have var x equals three, we are storing a value three in the variable x. So if I do a console dot log of x, what is it supposed to print? Obviously, it is supposed to print three. Similarly, if I do the same for y with the value of four, this is simply going to print me four. Now, if I do a var z equals to x plus y, and then I try to do a console dot log of z. What is the value it is going to print? Can you guess? Well, you have guessed it, right? It is simply going to print 7. So what do we understand out of here? That expressions doesn't necessarily have to be the direct values itself. You can even store these values into some variables and use variables in your expressions as well. That is also supported in JavaScript. So whenever there is a value which is directly visible in the code, we can also call them as literals. So since the value 3 and 4 are directly visible in the code, we are calling them as literals. But the value x plus y is not a literal. It is going to be considered as an expression. Expressions always need to be evaluated first and then only they can be printed. But the values are directly going to be visible in the code. So we simply call them as literals. So a quick debrief of what we have learned about expressions. So an expression can be concluded as a combination of literals. variables, operators and some other simple expressions that is always going to evaluate into a single value."

        "transcription": "In this video, let us now try to understand what are if-else conditions. So for the same, let's try to have one use case. So you have learned that using logical operators, we can test if a number is positive. So logical operators always give an answer in either a true or a false. Now let's say we have something like this. If the number is greater than zero, you have to print positive. If the number is less than zero, you have to print negative. Is this kind of a use case coverable under logical operators? That the answer is no, right? Because logical operators always answer in a true or a false. So what if we had to test this and then only print a message if this condition is met? Can we have something like that in JavaScript? Yes, we do. And for that, we have a concept which is known as if statement. So to... impose and check a condition, we can make use of if construct. So here's the syntax of how do we write an if statement. So you write the keyword if, then in the round brackets you have to specify the condition which you want to check. If this condition evaluates to true, then in a set of curly brackets you can write your statements which you need to execute. Let us take an example according to the use case we discussed. So let's go to repel it and let's make a variable. Let num equals five. Now if I want to print the number is positive only when the number is actually positive according to the condition. How can I do that? I can make use of if condition. So I'll say if, then in my round brackets I can say num greater than zero. In that case I want to say console.log of the number is positive. So, only when my number is going to be greater than 5, this condition is going to evaluate to true and only when the condition is evaluated to true, this line is going to execute, otherwise it's not going to execute. So let us first of all run this file to check, node space ifelse.js and as you can see the number is positive. What if the num was going to be a minus 5? What happens in that case? As you can see, there was no output on the shell. Why did that happen? Because when this condition was getting evaluated, minus 5 greater than 0. This evaluated out to false, which is the reason whatever is there inside the if block is never going to be executed. So this is how your if statements work. Alright, so now let us try to understand one more use case then. Now we have a requirement to compare a given number with zero. Now you have to print positive if it's a positive number and you have to simply print negative if it is a negative number. How can we do that? Because this time what is the difference from the previous use case? Now we have two conditions to be checked. Either a number can be positive or it can be negative. So how do we handle two conditions now? Well for that we also have if else statements. So you can add another block other than your if block which is going to be known as else block. So to impose and check a condition we can also make use of if else construct. And what is the syntax for that? Well this is the syntax for the same. The first part of it, the if condition is something that you already understand. And now think about the remaining part of it. Now let's say for a particular condition there are only two possibilities. So either something can be the first condition or it can be the second condition. So when you have already explicitly checked the first condition in the if block itself, do we really need to write the condition for the second one? Of course not, right? You only have the second one left. This almost equivalent of saying, let's say you have to choose between two colors, either blue or red. So if you have already checked the condition for blue in the if condition, there is no need to check for the red color again through the code, right? So in else block, we don't really write any condition. Else is the obvious one which is left out for us. So if the condition is not true, then automatically the else block will execute. So let us make the example for the same. So into the same example, if I now also want to consider the case of negative, I can just have an else block and I can say console.log the number is negative, right? And this is how we can consider both the situations, either the number would be positive or it would be negative. So if I now run this, do you see the difference? This time the output comes out and it is the number is negative. And why did this happen this time? Because when this code was getting run, minus 5 was getting checked in the if block. Is minus 5 greater than 0? No, the condition is false. So the if block is surely not going to execute, but its equivalent else block is definitely going to execute, right? That is why it printed the number is negative. Alright, so this is however if else conditions work. So here's a quick demo that you need to perform again. Test if a number is positive or negative by comparing it with 0. Print corresponding message based on the condition result using if else construct. Well, that is the same activity that we just performed over here. So try making use of some more examples. examples, and this is how we work with if-else statements."

        "transcription": "Okay, so now we will be discussing the problem cyclic rotation in the basic arrays category. So the problem is given an array of n integers and an integer k what we have to do we have to rotate the array k times in clockwise order. So given an array given an integer k that is a number of rotations what we have to do we have to rotate that particular array in the clockwise order what do you mean by clockwise order if I am saying the array is 1 2 3 4 5 if let's say this is the array that is having 5 elements n equal to 5 let's say I want to rotate for one time so what will be one time rotation in clockwise order clockwise is this so what we have to do we have to make one rotation from right towards the left that is after the rotation what will be the new array become the new array will be 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. This is after first rotation. Similarly, what will happen after second rotation? If k is equal to 2, we can say one more time, rotate the last element and bring it in the front. So, the remaining array or the resultant array will become 1, 2, 3, 4 shifted and then in the front we have 4, 5. So, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3. This is the answer after two rotations. Similarly, if I ask you what is the array after three rotations? The array after three rotations will be the last element which is nothing but 3 will be rotated in the front and if it is rotated in the front, what will the array become? It will become 3, 4, 5, 1, 2 and you can repeat this procedure again and again for more number of rotations. So, if I say for k equal to 4, what will happen? Obviously, now you can easily say that we will be having 2, 3, 4, 5 and then lastly 1. But what will happen for the k is equal to fifth rotation? For k is equal to fifth rotation, if I will say that in this array rotate the last element so what will be the rotation of last element one will come in the front and what will be the array the array will be 1 2 3 4 5 so actually I will get the same array back which was there in the input so if array is of n size the fifth rotation or the nth rotation will be going to give the same array back which was there in the input so this is also observation and let's now read the sample input sample output so in the input format what we are given we are given that there will be three lines of input containing first of all the integer n that is the size of array then there will be n space separated integers that is the array elements and the value of integer k that is how much rotation we need so if our array is of 5 size if the elements in the array are 1 2 3 4 5 after second rotation what will be the array 4 and 5 will come in the front 1 2 3 will go in the back and you can see the explanation also that is after the first rotation array will be 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 after the second rotation array will be 4, 5, 1, 2, 3 and the constraints can be array can have maximum number of 10 raised to power 6 elements actually so then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 actually not 10 raised to power 6 but 10 raised to power 5 elements and each array element will be from 1 up till 10 raised to power 5 again but the k value it is minimum 0 so we can have 0 rotations if we are having 0 rotations it means we are not rotating at all if we are not rotating at all then we are saying that array will be the same or the number of rotations can also be at max 10 raised to power 5 that is maximum we can rotate the array for 10 raised to power 5 times so it is not necessary that the array rotations will be less than or equal to n it is not given we can have number of rotations even more than the array size that is if let's say we are having the same array array having 5 elements we can rotate this array for 6 times also for 7 times also for 8 times also these can be the input. So we have to take care about these corner cases also. So now that we have discussed the problem statement that actually what is the question asking us to do and we have discussed certain test cases we will now be jumping on towards the second module that is nothing but finalizing the approach and going up from the root step for the solution. So what can be the most basic solution which we can think of the most basic solution which comes to my mind as a simple intuitive thinking is rotate one at a time rotate one at a time rotate one at a time that is if we are going to do k rotations one at a time it will rotate the array for k times. So if I just do a try run a proper quick try run for the brute force code so if let's say I am saying the array is having some more number of elements let's say the elements are 10 20 30 40 50 60 let's say there are six elements we are having the array values not one two three but 10 20 30 it can be anything and let's say the k value that is the number of rotations we need to do is three we need to rotate for three times so what we need to do for this brute force approach we are rotating one element at a time and if we are rotating one element at a time how can i rotate a single element that is how can i make the last element come in the front see if you are directly going to update 60 and make the array of 0 as 60 you will be losing the value of 10 10 value will be lost similarly if you are now going to say that i want to update it with 10 you are not having the value of 10 so instead of first updating the value of 10 with the new value which is 60 what should we do we should first store this 60 value in some temporary variable let's say temporary variable is temp i am saying the last value which we need to make it in the front is area of n minus 1 area of size minus 1 and it will be 60 in this case so store it in a temporary variable and now do the shifting so what will be the shifting looking like should I first shift 10 towards 20 no I will be first shifting 50 towards 60 because after rotation 60 will come in the front and all these elements will be shifted one position to the right side so first make the 50 element take the place of 60 that is this will become 50 then make the 40 take place of 50 then make the 30 take place of 40 similarly for 20 and similarly for 10 and now after all the shifting is done now we can easily make the new element that is a temporary value which we have rotated come in the front that is 60 will come in the front but this is for one rotation we will repeat this procedure for k times because k was 3 so I will be repeating this procedure for k times that is now again I will store this time temporary as an area of n minus 1 which is now not 6150 and do the shifting this will become 40 this will become 30 this will become 20 this will become 10 this will become 60 and that area of 0 will finally become the new value which is 50 similarly for the third time so this is how we can rotate so let's not have the prior and for k equals to 3 it will be very long if there will be some number of rotations what is single rotation taking how much time complexity it is taking order of n time complexity because i am running a loop and shifting all the values but for a single rotation for one element being rotated and coming in the front it is taking linear if i am going to rotate for k times k times rotation will take order of k into n because it will be like n plus n plus n k times and what will be the space actually i am not going to take any extra space so space will be actually constant why because we are doing it in place we are not making a new array we are updating the same array itself. So, it is kind of quadratic time complexity k into n. Can we reduce the time complexity? Most probably this will give time limit exceeded. So, is there any better way to do this rotations? We can say, what if we have a new array? What if we are allowed to create a new array? If we are allowed to create a new array, then most probably we can think directly in terms of k rotations, not one rotation at a time. So, the first optimization which I can think of is nothing but directly creating a new array. So, if you do not know about the array traversals or array creations, first you have to learn that concept and then only you will be able to come up with this optimization. So, let's say the input array was 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and what we wanted to do? We wanted to rotate for k is equal to 2 times. So, if we wanted to rotate for k is equal to 2 times that is the final. array what we need we need the last two elements should come in the front that is 50 as well as 68 should come in the front and remaining all the values should go in the last that is they will be shifted in the right side so if this is the input having six elements this is the output also having six elements first of all what we are saying create a new array which is the same size that is with the six elements but initially it will be obviously containing zeros because the default value of integers in most of the programming languages are zero by default every integer will be zero and what we are going to say i am going to make all the last elements which we are about to make them in the front get stored in the front hand side that is i will run a loop over all the values for the last k elements and i will bring them in the front and then the second iteration will be the all the remaining elements i will be making them go in the last so if i just now run a loop on all the remaining how many elements if these are k elements k is equal to 2 so what are the number of remaining elements it will be n minus k that is in this case 6 minus 2 which will be 4 elements so now i will be running a loop or over all the elements from 0 till up till less than n minus k all the indices from 0 to 3 and just store them in the remaining array in the remaining resultant and in this fashion so this resultant was only of 6 size not 6 index will exist i will be able to shift for k times because now i am able to rotate for k times only once and now in this case what is the time complexity which we are using since first i am running a loop on all the k elements and then all the n minus k elements overall time complexity will be k plus n minus k that is still order of n only so previously it was n into k but now it is n minus k plus k that is only an order of linear so what about the space complexity are we using any extra space yes that's what we discussed we have created a new array and if we have created a new array we are taking the order of an extra space due to the new array we are about to create so this is the first particular optimization we can easily code this most probably everyone should be able to code this but is there any even better further optimization possible and for even further optimization we should know that how we have to do the reversal of array if we know how to reverse array then we will be able to optimize further so the second possible optimization let's try to come up to the approach let's try to come up to a certain observation it is a purely observation or a pattern based optimization which we are about to discuss so again what we are doing is let's now this time take a bigger array even bigger array let's take a seven size array so that observation is clearer. Let's take seven elements in the array and let's take the number of rotations which we need to perform is k equal to 3. I need to perform three rotations. So what will be the resultant after three rotations? The resultant after three rotations will be 70 will come in the front then 60 will come in the front then 50 will come in the front that is 50, 60, 70 will go in the front but all the remaining elements will go in the right side that is 10, 20, 30, 40 will go in the right side. So if we are about to compare the input with the output what is the order of last k elements? The order of last k elements is same if it was 50, 60, 70 it is still 50, 60, 70 and for the elements of the order n minus k for the remaining n minus k elements what is the order it was 10, 20, 30, 40 it is still 10, 20, 30, 40 it is still the same so if we are doing a reversal 2 times. If we are going to do reversal 2 times, order will be same. If I am giving you array 10, 20, 30. If I ask you to rotate it or actually reverse it, what will be the array? 30, 20, 10. And if I again ask you to reverse it, what will be the new array? The new array will be 10, 20, 30 back because 2 times reversal will give me the same array back. So what we have to do? We want 50, 60, 70 to be in the same order but in the left hand side. Similarly, 10, 20, 30, 40 in the same order in the right hand side. So what we can think is we can maybe do reversal twice. Once for the n minus k elements, once for the k elements and then we have to think that what will be the intermediate array. So if I rotate or if I actually reverse the starting n minus k elements, what will be the array? It will be 40, 30, 20, 10. What if I reverse the last k elements? So if I reverse the last k elements, it will be 40, 30, 20, 10. become 70 60 and 50 but this array and the resultant array this red array and the blue array how i can convert the red array into the blue array if you carefully observe as we discussed that two times reversal will give me the same array back if i see this array from left to right or if i see this array from right to left similarly even if i see this array from right to left and i see this array from left to right it will be actually the same so the next part is nothing but reversal the entire array reversal of the entire n elements starting from the starting index going to the last index so what are the three points first point is reverse the starting n minus k elements that is if we talk in terms of indices we are reversing the indices from zero till third index so left pointer will be zero right pointer will be third index left till right we are going to reverse only this much part only this much part Then second time reversal will be for the last k elements that is if I talk about the particular example it will be from 4 to 6 from 4 to 6 and then actually reverse the entire array that is reverse the array from 0th index up till the last index from 0th index up till the 6th index but if we talk in general in general what will be 3 what will be 4 what will be 6 I can say 0 till 3 0 till all the numbers in n minus k elements so what will be the last index if I am saying n minus k elements it will be n minus k minus 1 so last index will be n minus k minus 1 that is if n was 7 k was 3 so n minus k minus 1 will be 7 minus 3 minus 1 that is the third index what about 4 you can say this is n minus k only it is actually equivalent to 7 minus 3 which is 4 what about 6 this is the last index of the array n minus 1 again 6 is nothing but n minus 1 so first reverse the starting n minus k elements then reverse the last k elements and then actually reverse the entire array if we are going to follow these three steps we are able to rotate the array by k points and in how much time complexity reversing n minus k elements will be taking order of n minus k times reversing k elements last k elements will be taking order of k time and reversing the entire array will also be taking order of n time so overall time complexity will be n minus k plus k plus n it will be k getting cancelled with k so n plus n it will be 2n so 2n is still linear because we definitely do not ignore we do ignore constants we do not take constants so it is linear in nature and what about the space are we using any extra space if we are going to do reversal it is going to be constant because reversal only require the two pointer logic so the space is constant or you can say any. place logic we are not taking any extra space so this is the best possible fashion in which we can solve this question linear time constant space solution so now that we have discussed this optimization let's now jump on to the instruction manual so first step what we need we need to call three functions so let's have a same function only let's have the function reverse so static reverse will not return anything to static void reverse where I will be passing the array where I will be passing the left and the right pointers both the pointers the starting index of the subarray which I want to reverse and the ending index of the subarray which I want to reverse and in this function we need to basically apply the reversal logic so how we can apply reversal logic we can apply reversal till the point left is smaller than right so we can say run a loop run a while loop preferably up till until left is a smaller than right left is smaller than right because if there is a sub array remaining if left is smaller than right then we can swap the elements so till this point what you have to do swap the array values present at which two indices at arrays left index and right index arrays left index and right index for this you should know how to reverse because reversal we have already covered you have to now only implemented in a particular sub array from left to right once we have some swap the values from left index with the right index using some inbuilt function you can use any inbuilt function provided to you in your particular programming language now what we have to do we have to swap the next two pairs if i give you a quick example let me say there is a array 10 20 30 40 if we need to reverse it what we have to do we have to first swap 10 with the 40 so it will become 40 this will become 10 and then left plus plus right minus minus swap 20 with 30 this will become 30 this will become so we now have to increment left and decrement right by one increment left by one and decrement right by one up till which point up till the point till the loop runs so once the reversal is done once we have written the code in the main actual logic we are just going to call it for three times so I am going to call this function call the function reverse for array in the range 0 up till up till n minus k minus 1 where n is the array dot length so initialize we can maybe initialize n as array dot length or it is given in the parameter or itself then call the reverse function or you can say reverse the part call the reverse for array in the range that is nothing but n minus k up till up till n minus 1 that is passed left as n minus k and pass right as n minus 1 and then finally all the reverse for the array entire that is from 0 to n minus 1 once we have called these three functions what we need to do we can return the same array itself because we are not using any extra array so last point will be written on the same input array that is hierarchy so this is nothing but the pseudocode but one point which is still remaining is nothing but what do you think will be a corner case when the number of rotations will be more than the number of the elements in the array what will happen if the k will be more than n if k will be more than n then this logic will vary why let's see if i am having an array with four elements if i am having a let's say k value five so what we are saying in this logic we are saying first reverse the zero up till up till n minus k minus so what is n minus k minus 1 it is 4 minus 5 minus 1 4 minus 5 minus 1 will become how much it will become minus 1 minus 1 minus 2 so there is no minus index so this negative index will not exist or even if you want to apply it it will go into index out of bound so if k is more than n what should we do actually we should reduce the value of k how we can reduce the value of k as you can clearly see after the zeroth rotation or the fourth rotation or the eighth rotation or twelfth rotation array will be same similarly after first rotation fifth rotation ninth rotation thirteenth rotation array will be same similarly for second rotation the sixth rotation tenth rotation 14th rotation and so on the array will be same why because if we are rotating for four times it is equivalent to not rotating at all for array of four sides if we are rotating for four times we are not rotating at all same goes for third rotation or seventh or eleventh or fifteenth it is one in the same thing so how we can go to the value of zero given value of 4 8 12 16 all the multiples of 4 all the multiples of n We can say this is nothing but k modulus n, this is nothing but k modulus n, 5 modulus 4 will be 1, 9 modulus 4 will be 1, 13 modulus 4 will be 1. So reduce all the bigger values into smaller values by updating the k as k modulus n, that is if we are given 12 rotations, we will not do 12 rotations, we will say we will do 12 modulus 4, 0 rotations. If we are given 13 rotations, we will not do 13 rotations because if we are going to do 13 rotations, it will be index out of 1, we will do 13 modulus 4 which is only 1 rotation, only 1 rotation we can do, we can have n-k and k elements or you can say this is k, this is n-k. So first before applying these 3 points, these 3 reversals, first step we should do is update k as k modulus n to reduce the value from, reduce the value in the range 0 till n-1, reduce the value. Now the code will be... complete what we have to do first of all code the reversal part that is we have to run a while loop up till the point left is smaller than right we can also run the loop even till left is equal to right less than equal to but left smaller than right will also work what we have to do every time swap the array values present at left index present at right index so in order to swap those values we can use any inbuilt function or you can also actually write your code yourself you can write the code exactly here that is let's take a temporary variable add array of left make the array of left become array of right and then array of right will become left so it is your choice whether you want to use any inbuilt function or not once we have swapped the values present at left and right pointers what we have to do increment left by one that is left plus plus decrement right by one that is right minus minus so this is the reversal code from a sub array left till right In the main logic what you have to do first of all reduce the value of k so that it becomes in the range of 0 till n-1 so that index outer bound does not happen. Once we have updated the value of k now we need to call the reverse function for 3 parts first from 0 up till up till n-k-1 then reverse from n-k up till up till n-1 and finally the entire array. It was purely based on observation that we have done in the last particular video. So finally reverse the entire array. Once we have reversed these 3 parts one by one we will be returning the entire input array exactly same array because we are not taking any extra space. So if we run this logic on the sample input let's see what will happen and then we will check for the corner cases. So this code is running for the sample list case if we are doing 2 rotations 4 and 5 are coming in the front 1 2 or 3 are going in the right side let's say we are having five values 1 2 3 4 5 we are not doing any rotations at all number of rotations is zero what will be the output array output array will be the same input array itself that is 1 2 3 4 5 let's see if it is the same array or not yes it is the same array even if i do five rotations for an array of five size what will be the answer five more or less five array should become zero rotation that is same array itself again so let's see if it is the same array or not if it is going to give me the same array for five rotations and it is running it is taking some time yes it is giving me the same array what will happen for let's say i am saying 10 rotations or maybe not 10 but 9 9 rotations will be covalent to 9 more or less 5 4 rotations because 5 rotations will be just a waste so 5 4 rotations will be 2 3 4 5 in the front 1 in the last so output should be 2 3 4 5 1 let's see if it is going give me the same output or not and it is actually giving me so let's submit this and if it is going to work fine then what was the time complexity of this problem the time complexity was linear what was the space complexity of this problem code the space complexity was nothing but constant because we are not taking any extra space we are doing it in place are there any follow-ups which you can solve this for this problem which can come in an interview surely yes what if the rotations are not left words actually not right words not clockwise if they are left words that is they are in the anti-clockwise direction then what will you do you have to think in terms of that that is negative rotations how will you handle the negative rotations maybe if k will be minus one k will be minus two k will be minus three you can think in terms of that one more uh problem can be reversing a 2d array a matrix how will you be able to reverse a 2d matrix using the same logic so So once you have learned those concepts, you can go through those questions also that is reversing in anticlockwise direction and once you learn 2D matrix, you can solve a problem based on reversing a 2D matrix or you can at least think of the time and space complexity."

I've done BTech in mechanical engineering in TKR college, and I've done my master's in maintenance engineering from United Kingdom in the university of central Lancashire. I was in UK for the course. After that, due to some personal reasons, I had to come back to India. Then I decided to join IT field and my interest for IT grew, and then I researched about courses which could give me a good future, and then I came to know about cryo.do, and then I joined cryo, and now I'm an associate software developer in Gizmo. As my interest grew, I was looking for some courses that could secure my future. So I was researching online. While researching, I came across cryo.do. It had good reviews. Cryo.do also had a mock sessions initially. So I joined one of those, and during that, they explained about the course curriculum and all, and I was impressed by it, and I thought cryo could guide me in the right direction. During cryo.do, I learned latest front-end and back-end technologies which are used in companies nowadays, which include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ReactJS to build web applications. And also in back-end, I learned NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB. The thing that I enjoyed the most is building projects. Real-time projects were given to us like Amazon or YouTube. The best way I would say to learn anything is by doing it. So I would describe it as learn by doing only. That is why I like the curriculum of Cryo and the learning way of Cryo."

        "transcription": "It's more about like you know more about me than I do right? How do I feel secure about giving my data to a machine? So basically having more data we are going to be able to personalize, avoid let's say I can avoid doing mundane tasks but then how can I be sure the more let's say it's more about like you know more about me than I do right? How do I feel secure about giving my data to a machine? Okay so I would say it depends on how enterprises handle data. Different enterprises handle data differently. So if you take IBM for example, we are hell bent on making sure we are ethical. The data that we have is you know legal, we don't infringe on copyrights. There is a whole team out there sitting and ensure ensuring that this happens. and there is no HAP, which is hate, abuse and profanity, that doesn't come in. So, all the models that are built, I can speak for IBM and quote that as an example, all the models that we build, you know, you need lots and lots of data to build models. So, all this data is wetted out, you have a team looking into it, cleansing it, sanitizing it to ensure bias, hate, abuse, profanity, or PII, personally identifiable information, all this is removed before we make our models. And if the customer has some data, we ensure that is protected as well. So, that is one of the primary concerns for every customer, right? So, you will have to go with an enterprise who ensure you that they take care of this. That is the only way. That is where, you know, AI governance has come into picture, where AI governance and data governance, where you know the lineage of data, and you ensure that the data is not accessible to people who should not access it, or visible to people who should not see it. And the models are also tested to ensure that it is fair, there is no bias, and it is explainable. When I say this, I'll give you an example. So you apply for a loan in a bank. It gets rejected. So you want to know, why did you reject my loan? So we should be able to explain to you that your loan got rejected for these three reasons, and those reasons should be fair. I shouldn't have rejected you because of your caste or ethnicity, or based on your gender. So I should be able to give you... you a fair explanation of why my model rejected you, right? So all these things have to be taken care of. So we have to go with enterprises who ensure they do this, not everyone does. On top of what you said, right? Let's say we go with an enterprise which actually follows this. But again, there is a point of data breach which can happen. Today, normally, if there is a data breach, there is a level of adversity which can happen. But if this is going to be like more of a sensitive data and it's also, if the impact of the data can be huge, though, let's say the enterprise is very morally right, and if the data gets breached, it can fall into the wrong hands, right? How do we avoid it in the generation of AI? First thing is AI can play a big role in security, okay? Where, excuse me, we can detect a potential breach in security very quickly. So it is a play. of AI and the hardware. So you have a bank where it is getting bombarded with GPA payments or UPI payments. UPI payments happen several at a second for a country like India, right? So very quickly, you need to have that hardware which can process this and detect that there is a fraud happening. At the same time, you need to have a good model, AI model, which has seen the pattern and it understands that there is a fraud happening. So AI plays a very big role in security. So you were talking about data security. So with data also, a lot of things are in place where people ensure that data is encrypted in place or in movement. Again, these are precautions and technology. which individual enterprises have to adopt and ensure it doesn't happen and they have to again make sure that you don't collect PII information when it is not required. You have to ensure people are not given access to it. It's encrypted, stored in a proper way. Even if it's going to happen you should have the technology or AI in place to detect that immediately and take measures. There are a lot of measures that's happening around it like the governance, AI governance that countries are putting together. I think India was speaking about its own AI Governance Council or something around that. So all countries have regulations around AI which is coming out. One of them is the European Union Act and you know US is coming up with something. So all these people require certain metrics from your model and from your data. So, what kind of metrics? There are metrics to measure fairness, explainability, bias. So, you need to ensure these things are followed and kept in place, so that you do not violate those regulations. So, AI governance, that is what it means. You govern the AI to ensure these regulations are followed. You also govern the AI to ensure that the data which is coming in is governed. You know the lineage, where this data came from, how it is managed, etc. And you also know the whole life cycle that this model has gone through, who has built it, what has it gone through. So, all this comes into AI governance. You"

Since I didn't have developer experience, I joined Cryo as a full-time web developer student. Yeah, I've been doing it from past seven to eight months. During the program, I learned front-end and back-end. From the front-end perspective, I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and from the back-end perspective, I've learned Express. You get to learn something new and after learning it through the mentors, you get to implement on your own. I enjoyed it a lot. In Cryo, I enjoyed the way the course goes, the way the mentor supports on every aspect, all the projects that I've done. I have thoroughly enjoyed all the journey of this in Cryo. Of course, we faced a lot of challenges, a lot of difficulties, but I think Cryo made it easy through the doubt-clearing sessions, which happens every alternative days. Before joining Cryo, I didn't have developer experience and I was only good at DSA. But, if I had to go and give an interview to any companies, I was not much confident because I didn't have the relevant skills. But after joining Cryo, I am pretty much confident with my front-end skills. It has really helped me build my confidence and approach HRs in a very confident way.

        "transcription": "I started learning about web development because people told me that if you learn about web development, you will get an edge. I know the requirements, someone else will tell me what to do, so I can do it on my own. It gets a little difficult to think by yourself, you have to think about the requirements yourself, then you have to implement it yourself, so it gets a little difficult. Till now I have found Cryo as the best platform because Cryo platform allows you to work on real-world projects. On top of that, you get industry-like experience, like an internship, so I liked it a lot. My first impression was in the trial week, so whatever bytes I did there, like REST, my HTTP, so I was impressed from there that the content is good, there is no video in the content, which I didn't even want because before that I had seen so many videos that I didn't like the video, so my mind was not active after watching the video at that time because I had read all the content, so the mind remains active while reading, so according to that the content was very good. and then apply all those things, it was all good. I have developed an ability that in the phase of back-end development, how do we tackle all the challenges that we face? And how do we become independent that we can solve most of the problems ourselves? This was the ability that I developed in the whole phase, which should be a very important ability in everything, that most of the problems you should be able to solve on your own. So I learned this. The platform was very easy to use. I didn't have to install anything. Everything was in the workspace. Go and open everything from there. My entire command line was there. So it was great that we could install a lot of things on our computer, because computers slow down a lot when you install a lot of things. But because there was a workspace, the workspace worked very smoothly. Projects are the most important to build a career in tech. The more you focus on projects, the more you work on projects, the more your skill level will increase. And the company needs skill level. So the more you work on your skills, the more you work on your projects, the more you will be successful. your confidence level will increase, your technical knowledge will increase, which will be beneficial for you."

        "transcription": "Based on how many years you've been working in the software industry, I can tell that you must be earning at least this much every year. Did I get it right? If you're earning anything less than how much you should be earning, then you are definitely underemployed. Is this the first time you're hearing about this term? Don't worry. Today, we are going to decode what it means to be underemployed. And if you stick around till the end of the video, you'll have a fair idea what needs to be done to get out of this career situation. If you're new to the channel or haven't yet subscribed, click on that bell icon right away to stay updated with most practical strategies and actionable tips to take your career to new heights. So what is underemployment? Is it the same as being unemployed? The answer is no. Unemployment means that you don't have a job and are actively looking to get employed. On the other hand, underemployment means being employed in a job requires low skill and does not pay you well. If you look up the term on Wikipedia, this is what you will see. Underemployment is the underuse of a worker because a job does not use the worker's full skills. If you know someone who falls under this category, share this video with them right away because the following parts of the video could change their lives. If you're still not sure how to recognize whether you're underemployed or not, let's see how you can measure it for yourself. Number one, how would you rate the quality of the work you're doing? Think about the kind of work you do and the value you add to the company. Are you satisfied with the work? If you're not 100% confident about your answer, hold that thought and let's look at another factor. Your CTC versus your experience. How much are you earning for the years of experience you have? Is it on par with the rest of the people in your industry? Talk to your friends or use this table to find out where you stand. Maybe your work doesn't feel meaningful anymore or the industry and the technologies have evolved. All this could mean that you're stuck in your career. Checking the two things, which are the quality of your work and your CTC versus your years of experience, this will give you a fair idea of whether you are underemployed. or not. Here's a quick question for you. In the past, how many times have you thought about changing your job? Once? Twice? Every other month? And how many times did you do something about it? If your answer is zero, you're at the right place. Most times, this realization of being stuck in your career is just a fleeting thought. Very few actually do something about it. If you've made it this far in the video, like the video and let us know in the comments what exactly about your work makes you want to change your job every now and then. Let's get to the bottom and try to understand why it has been so difficult for you to take that step forward in your career or why some people don't even realize that they have to upgrade their careers. But before that, let's look at the five major signs which would tell if you're stuck in your career or if you're underemployed. 1. Your potential is much greater than your job. You often think of being more skilled and competent than what your work demands for you. You're not challenged enough in your current role. 2. Worried about job safety. Constantly worrying about your job safety. Do you think a bunch of freshers or juniors may replace you anytime and that makes you want to give your best in your job? Being in fear is a definite characteristic of being underemployed. As the job you are doing doesn't require much skills, this fear might drive you to a poor work-life balance and a career burnout. 3. No transferable skills. Are your current skills going to get you hired for another job? If your skills today are too specific to a project or the tech used in your current company, it's going to make you less employable for another job. Once you recognize the skills you need for the job you want, don't just let that be a thought. Start upskilling yourself and level up your career. 4. Not learning new things. Ask yourself this question. Did you learn anything new in the past 6 months? It could be processes, technology, domain, anything. If that's not happening in your work, you are definitely stuck. 5. Is your work repetitive in nature? Are you doing the same thing over and over again? Doing the same work day in and day out could be a drawback to your career. Sure, it might feel quite comfortable now, but eventually, the lack of growth is going to leave you feeling stuck. This could also hurt your earning potential in the long run. Do you relate to any of these major signs? If your answer is yes, hit that thumbs up and let's continue to see why you haven't changed your career yet or did not even realize that you are on the right path. underemployed till now. Underemployment is a very common thing in the IT industry. And so even the companies have begun to adopt interesting ways to retain you without making you think too much about your career situation. One of the most powerful ways for the companies to make you stay for long is by providing on-site opportunities. On-site used to be attractive in the early 2000s, not so much now. Also the ratio of employees on-site versus offshore is very skewed. More importantly, you're left to the mercy of your manager or your company. So this might not happen ever. But you know what? This strategy absolutely works for the companies and you know it. So if you want to move to a different location, there are better ways to do it. You can either get into a good company and transfer internally later. Or if you have the right skills, you can directly apply for jobs outside India. Another interesting thing that companies do is give a performance reward. Star of the month, employee of the year, et cetera, et cetera. These rewards aren't bad, but ask yourself, does it really have an impact on your career growth? Sure, it will raise your morale and make you feel better than your peers. Does that change the fact that you're still underemployed? Similar to performance rewards. Another thing that keeps you from changing your jobs is the appraisal. When your manager promises you a promotion or a salary bump in let's say next 6 months, what do you do? You immediately start working towards getting the promotion or hike in salary. But do you ever stop to wonder, is it really worth it? Think about what is the best raise you can get in this underemployed job. 25%, at best 40%. And then what? The moment it is given for a year, you know what the next 2 years are going to look like. It's not going to change your career trajectory. And the real problem is not with your company or your manager, it's about the work you do and every job has a salary ceiling. What I mean by salary ceiling is, say you are paying your cook Rs. 2000 for 20 meals. Let's assume your cook makes exceptional food and deserves extra Rs. 1000 per month. After that, would you be willing to increase their pay just because they are very good at their job? No, right? For the same skill, your cook's salary has touched the ceiling and it has no scope to go above that. Same goes with your work as well. Which is why it is important to update your skills and keep moving forward in your career. If you are still not convinced about taking charge of your career, think about this. After 10 years of your career, would you rather be making 40 lakhs per annum or 12 lakhs per annum? It's not too late to get 40 lakhs per annum by year 10. Even if you're 3-4 years in your career and are earning anything less than 6 lakhs per annum, you can easily shift to a job that pays you 2 times your current salary. And from then on, your salary would continue to grow than it would in your current position. It may not double every year, but still would be a significant growth in your earning potential over a period of time. Tell me now, do you still want to sit on the thought of changing your job? If you have made up your mind to shift, your next step is to gain the skills software companies are looking for. Options are plenty. You could explore the idea of doing an MBA and getting into managerial roles, consider product management, learn data science, cloud, get hands-on with software development skills. Whatever it is that you pick, think about what excites you the most. Take time to explore different skills before locking on the type of skills you wish to pursue. Talk to the people who have done similar transitions in the past and understand how their journey has been. At the same time, don't give in to FOMO. You don't have to do something just because everyone is talking about it. it or you have taken a particular direction in your career. Be practical and focus on what you see yourself doing in the next 10 years. If you think this video has helped revive your career, do share it with your friends or family members, letting them know which part of the video helped you take charge of your career. More importantly, let this not be yet another time you just thought about changing your career. Now that you know how to break this pattern of staying stuck in your career, start taking action today."

Their coding and style is going to be really different. Microsoft had low-level system design, high-level system design. Even when it comes to coding, they are very fond of string questions. And then when it comes to Google, they are more about solving less number of questions, but then they want to know more about your thinking process. When it comes to Meta, it's all about speed and verification. They want clean code, but then completely test it. So I understood all this just by interviewing at multiple places. You can also talk to people and read about it to understand. So first, you'll give your resume. If that goes through, you have a phone screen round. Then you'll have another four rounds for on-site. So you will give two coding. So at least Meta is going to be heavily coding-oriented. So you're having three coding rounds. And then you have one system design, one behavioral.

So this category is for individuals who are able to upscale from a manual QA role to automation QA roles. So Aayush transitioned from a manual QA role to an automation engineer role at Builder.ai. Congratulations Aayush. Aayush is actually here with us today. Aayush, would you like to come on screen and tell us a couple of words to the CRIER community here today? Yeah, so first of all, thank you for this. Thank you for inviting me and making me such special. And if I tell about myself, so I am a 2022 batch graduate, like last year only I graduated and after that I got employed at Wipro as a manual tester. After got employed at Wipro. by side I was also pursuing an internship like from cryo dot only which made me to switch my career from manual to directly into an STET but this this line these two three lines are very simple but the work is between those lines. So like I belong to basically a tier 4 college in which hardly any company came into my college due to that was a covid time hardly like 2.2 lpa 3 lpa like maximum was 3.3 lpa which was the maximum package in our college the company came and as you all know like the college loop which says that if the student having no no backlogs is the best one in the whole college. So that loop I was stuck in that loop when I was in my fourth year after then I realized that reading books and clearing exams will not help me to get into that particular job because the job interviewer will need the skills. which I don't have, but it was too late for me to understand, but one skill I was having that was communication and the second one was the aptitude. My aptitude was very much good from which I have taken the exam of Amcad and CoCubes and from that I got employed at Wipro. But once I was again employed at Wipro, I was stuck in that same loop again because the profile which was manual testing and the second thing was that the tools which Wipro was using were not being used anywhere in the market. So the same Tar4 college thing came into my job profile also, so I was so much afraid. But one of my friend named Devashish, like me, he would also be there, I don't know. So he advised me to join Crab.Duo, but like it took me two months to join Crab.Duo because of the fees, because like from I was only paying by myself only, but I decided to join no matter what will happen. I was just manifesting the things like all those things would be okay and all those things would be going good. So I joined grad or 2. But the second thing which I was afraid of that like the fees is not the matter I would pay but would I be able to learn or not because I was not being able to write the program for adding the two numbers also and currently I am clearing hacker test and the two three technical rounds also and having multiple offers in hand till now also. I'm getting the offers. So like the one line I would like to say because we have only two three minutes as mamas told us so like cryo doesn't make you learn it make you how to learn like never ask for help until and unless you have tried all those things which you have in your mind. So those things I have like making a note of that like first day it took me 24 hours second day. It took me two hours less like it continues till one month and after one month deep boost which I have experienced in myself like I was solving like 10 to 15 programs. single day only, in a single day only and also doing my office work also. So, it it will take you time but it would be beneficial. So, the hard work would be there but hard work would be there for only less period of time and the benefit which you will get it would be maybe for some people would be for their life also but the benefit would be more valuable than your hard work. So, that's all from my side. Well said, well said Ayush. Thank you very much and congratulations on winning the Hall of Fame and welcome to Cryo Hall of Fame. Thank you very much. Moving on, let's go to the next winner in this category and the category is Exceptional Career Transitions QA to Automation QA. Okay, now our next winner in this category is Dineshwar Babbar.

        "transcription": "Okay, so I'm Sunita. I work in J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and my role is SDA-1. SDA-1 at J.P. Morgan. That's amazing. Can you tell us what the favorite part about your job as a software engineer is? Okay, so I get to work and solve some problems. I work as a backend engineer. So we get to learn a lot of things about backend engineering and I'm just growing day by day and that's amazing. That's amazing. So, alright, so take us through what your daily routine looks like. What a software engineer at J.P. Morgan, what their day would look like? Okay, so I just get up early in the morning. Then I just go to office. Then we have a great team bonding in our office. So great culture. So we just talk to each other, then solve problems. We have a lot of teamwork and leadership things going on in the team. So solve problems. then release our work, whatever we have done, then solve bugs, then production issues, so this is how it looks like. That's amazing. I'm going to ask you the same question. Alright, very cliche interview question. Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Okay, so in 5 years what I think is, I'll get knowledge of more things, like in the backend engineering as well as the frontend engineering. So I want to be a full stack developer at a higher level of management and want to do some exciting and new things in this industry. That's great. So for someone who is looking forward to be in a position as you are, right? A software engineer at J.P. Morgan, for people who are looking up to you, what is a word of wisdom that you'd like to give them? Okay, do coding of course and do not lose your hand in the coding data structures and algorithms. Thank you very much. Did you enjoy the interview? your time at CanConnect today? It was great, food was great, then the team officer was great and the founder and the interaction with them was great. It was amazing. That's amazing. Thank you for coming."

        "transcription": "Thanks a lot, Ajay. Thanks for the introduction and an awesome kickoff. Hey, folks, I'm Sridhar Jayachandran, one of the co-founders of Cryo.do. And before starting Cryo, I was a product manager with Google, primarily working on the social products of Google. And I started my journey as an engineer as well. So working primarily on the TCPIP stack in FreeBSD-based kernel. And from there, I moved to Google, where I was working mostly on the horizontal scaling aspects. Whenever you use YouTube chat or Google Hangouts or Google Plus, right, I was working with a team that used to store that data. All right. So we started off with Cryo a couple of years back, an exciting venture where we actually tried to reinvent the way people learn. And we'll get started right with the session on HTTP. Hope all of you are excited. So what is it we are going to do now? You know that. HTTP is one of the very important protocols that's what powers internet so I'm going to quickly help you understand how you are going to learn on the platform and also introduce you to how the HTTP protocol works all right let's get started. If you have ever attended an interview that's one of the very common questions what happens when you type www.google.com right very very common question so how do you go about answering that question you can actually give a very superficial answer or really go go go deep right how does it work now think of how the entire internet works right and also if you have ever observed if when you visit a site you get all these numbers like 404, 401, 500 what do they really mean have you ever thought about them and this is another thing right like you do a payment and then you press the back button and then you see a huge box that say hey don't press the back button right and if you press the back button it's going to say i'm going to resubmit the form which means that you might be charged more so as a part of HTTP byte you are going to understand all these things with very hands-on activities all right let's get started i'm going to show you live on how the whole HTTP protocol works i'm going to use as for the demonstration i'm going to open something called the chrome developer tools every single browser will have some sort of a developer tool okay and there are several tabs as you can see over here it's one of the very crucial tools that a front-end developer needs and we are going to use this for us to understand some of the things as to what happens beneath the browser right i'm going to go to the network tab and then quickly reload this page Okay, here we go, you can clearly see that we issued a HTTPS call, right, the browser issued a HTTPS colon slash slash www dot create dot do, it's a GET request and what it means is that whenever you are actually going to a site, the browser says, hey, I want to get this page, correct, it does a GET and then it is actually working on the basis of HTTP protocol. Now, I got a successful response, which is denoted by this green color icon and this two hundred status code. If you were to see, we never did anything with respect to this particular IP address, right, all I had done was just type cryo dot do, but somehow from somewhere this IP address came into being. So where did it come from, right, the answer lies in something called the DNS server, let's say that I want to visit Google. I'm going to do a command called dig www.cryo.do You can see that as a part of the command, you get a response back for this dig command and it sends several different IP addresses, a DNS server is something it's called a domain name server. It sits somewhere probably with your ISP, like whether you are using BSNL, Airtel or whatever connection you use, they might most likely be having some DNS server. So the moment you type cryo.do on your browser, the browser is going to ask the operating system. Hey, I want to reach this guy cryo.do, who should I talk to, right? Then your operating system contacts the DNS server and it issues a request somewhat similar to this. And then the DNS server is sending you back a list of possible IPs where you can contact cryo.do. So you can see that it's not just sending one entry, but 54.188. 192.0.18, 0.97, 95, 84 and that means that your browser can establish connection with any of these IPs. All right, let's see what connection we have established. Here we are doing it with 54.192.0.84, all right. So if you were to just like quickly see what happened, I type www.cryo.do on the browser, the browser asks the operating system, hey, where can I reach cryo.do? It went to the DNS server, fetched the IP back for this particular domain and then that is what my browser is talking to, all right. So what about the second part? What does this 443 mean, right? This is directly coming from the protocol you are using, right. For HTTP, it is 443 and if you are using HTTP, sorry, for HTTPS, it is 443 and if you are using HTTP, it is going to be port 80. Let's quickly verify that as well. I'm going to go. to a different site and then do the same thing to confirm that HTTP works on port 80. Alright, let me load the page, wow, it's loading quite a bit of stuff. You can see that I have talked to the particular domain on HTTP colon and then it is also a GET request, I got a 200 response, you can see that the port number to which the particular connected on the remote server is 80. So directly there is a correspondence between this HTTP and 80. Similarly, in the other page, it was between HTTPS and port 443. Alright, now let's go to the next steps. We got a response back from the server right after talking to the server on this particular IP. And the response type is text HTML, right? Essentially, I'm saying, I want to load this webpage and then the server responds back with a html file all right and you can actually get some more details from this response if you have to let's say understand which particular server is cryo hosting their front end on right you can clearly see that it is Amazon s3 all right let's go check out the exact html response that we got from the server you can see that this is html right it contains all the various things that are actually getting displayed over here correct so let me search for something let's see let's pick up okay I'm going to search for this text in this html fine okay it was a wonderful journey you can see that whatever is getting rendered on the website is also part of the response so the html file is being rendered after applying all the styling by the browser if you have to go to this preview you can see how the rendering is going to happen you can see that it is actually rendering the page but there is something missing like all these images are actually missing but if you were to see the finished site right over here on the left side everything is getting loaded so what exactly is happening why is the preview for this particular network call not showing the image but on the left side it is actually showing everything this is something for you to think about if you just like go through the other requests over here you will be really able to find an answer and this is exactly the reason why you would learn on the cryo platform right everything that you kind of have a question about etc can be experimented instead of kind of guessing okay you know what this is related to this or it is related to that it is because the network is slow whatever you could come up with you could just like go search it in Google and then come back and then just like inspect the resource a bit over here then you would be able to come up with a very good answer All right, OK, so now let's just quickly summarize what we understood. You can see that on the browser, we type www.cryo.to. It actually got to the DNS server, got the IP address, which is 205.251.53.111 over here. And then because it is HTTPS, it is going to be port 433 on the remote server. My laptop is issuing a request, and it is getting the cloud server, which is AWS in our case. The AWS server is actually responding back with a HTML file. And then it gets to the laptop, and then it gets rendered beautifully on the browser. So this is the end-to-end working of the HTTP protocol. So what are you going to do with this? You're going to start with the HTTP byte, which is you're going to be your first byte in the Cryo Interrupt doing journey, all right? And you're going to get a. sneak peek into how the whole Chrome developer tools work, you would be able to see whatever I just like them on, right. You would go to Chrome developer tools, visit flipkart.com, see what is the HTTP request, response, right. And then you will be able to play around with more things. And then you need to understand what are the HTTP verbs, right? Like things like get, post, what are the difference between post and port? When should you use get? When should you use post, right? So you would get a much more familiar idea about these again by doing some hands-on exercises. I've already talked about this, the status codes like 200, 404, 500, 301. What do these exactly mean? Next time after doing the byte, if you see any of them, you would clearly be able to say this is a client error, this is an auth error, right? Or it is a server error, right? That kind of a confidence you will be able to build up. One of the very useful utilities is curl. If you ask any web developer, backend developer, they are going to say cURL is actually their lifeline ok what it is going to do is whatever your browser is capable of doing like sending a request get request post request etc can also be done through cURL ok it's a terminal tool and one of the important things for you to understand is what is this HTTP protocol work on top of correct if somebody asks you this question in an interview how would you go about answering you might say ok based on various things you have learned in the past you can say ok you know what maybe it is UDP maybe it is TCP right how do you prove that to somebody correct so in the HTTP belt what you are going to do is you are going to create a bad TCP connection and then create your own HTTP request and then send it on top of the TCP connection that way in your life you will never forget which protocol HTTP sits on top of alright ok I am going to quickly do a platform demo now, where I'll show you the various parts of the platform and how you're going to get started doing the bytes, all right. First and foremost step is to actually go to cryo.to site, visit sign in, it's going to show you a list of different gmail ids. If you have logged into multiple gmail ids, you have to use one of your gmail ids to sign into cryo platform, please make sure that you have registered this with us as a part of your application. I'm going to choose one of the ids, all right, so this is our onboarding flow, where you're going to select the cryo winter of doing stage one. Okay, decent coding skills, want to upgrade my skill sets. Okay, if you haven't joined the community, please do so if you have any issues joining the community, please do let us know by email and then we'll make sure that you are part of the community. Okay, I'm going to skip this for now because I'm already done, then I'm going to get started on the platform. Okay, we're going to see something like this where it's going to say cryo winter of doing stage one, view ongoing activities. please make sure that you click on view ongoing activity and then if you have not completed the Sherlock mystery exercise feel free to do that right now I'm going to focus on starting the program okay click on start program it's going to take a few seconds to load all right so this is kind of your rough plan okay so it's going to start off all the way from http byte then you will move on to rest linux basics deploying the app and aws then git basics and finally queue profile okay so to start with you are going to do the http byte I'm going to click on unlock over here it's going to take maybe a minute or so max okay if it doesn't load just like do a refresh and then it should start working Okay, the HTTP byte is unlocked already for me, I'm going to click on continue. All right, so we are all set to start with the HTTP byte. Before that, let me quickly do a platform demo. There are four icons on the left, you can see that the first one which is where we started off is the activity board. Okay, so this is where your activity for the week comes into picture. And then the third icon is where you will be doing all the exercises. All right, I'm going to refresh over here, you'd see that you have this option of using the workspace. Okay, I'm going to click on open a new tab. This is where you will be using the workspace, okay, but you don't have to install anything on your laptop, all the things that are necessary for you to complete the stage one of the program is you can use it completely. It's going to take a few seconds. I'm going to just like go back and then show the other option. So this is a progress dashboard. It is where you will actually find what are the various other things you will actually go about doing. So whenever you complete any module or the byte, you go come to this particular screen or the activity board and then you can actually click on the unlock for the next ME. All right. Okay. It's going to see if the workspace is loaded. It may actually ask you to sign up into the good part. Okay. So it will either use your GitHub account or your gitlab.com account, either one, and then click on continue, accept their terms and conditions, and then it will show you up something like this, where you have the terminal over here and then you can do whatever file editing you want over here. Okay. We'll be using this extensively as a part of the program. So just like make sure that you are comfortable with this. All right. Okay. Let's get back. to this main thing which is called the task dashboard which is where all the action happens okay there is a overview button which just like says what you're going to learn as a part of this byte and then you will move on to the actual task board so over here you have this overview section right it's just like hazard video which is very similar to what I just like walked you through there are two primary goals over here and you move on to the task board in the task board it's nothing but a bunch of activities for you to do and you will actually learn from these activities okay so over here you have to do you have to go to chrome and then open flipkart.com just the way I did and then you will open the developer tool and then learn all these different aspects of HTTP request okay this is not for reading okay if you're going to used to reading break that habit the moment you start doing things right instead of just like seeing what kind of like reading through right the kind of takeaway you have is way way different the kind of confidence it brings to you is going to be very very different okay so please don't read through it go ahead try it out it's not going to take too much of time okay you go through the exercises it's going to say do this do that etc and then there may be some references towards the end which you can go there to learn more then there's also a section called curious cats it's going to just like probe you a bit more deeper right some fun stuff like okay what if this were to happen or did you ever think about this right so these are questions that would just like definitely push you towards your childhood of being inquisitive all right finally there may be some questions towards the end let me give a wrong answer and then see what happens you can see that it it gave me the correct answer and then said why the current answer is wrong and as you also noticed the next activity got unlocked right milestone 2 got unlocked in this particular milestone I'll go ahead and then understand things related to get, pose, put again through hands-on exercises. Finally, I'll come down if I want to get more details I might go through the reference or the curious cat questions and again the quizzes. Once you are done you go to the next one continue doing that throughout the byte. As soon as you are done you can go back to the this page activity board or the progress dashboard the unlock button will show up on the next byte you can actually the unlock button will show up over here click unlock go to the next byte. All right so that is how the whole learning process happens on the cryo platform. All right so I hope whatever you saw so far was interesting and I hope you are able to make progress on the HTTP byte. Now let's try to do something very interesting from here. Okay what I'm going to do is try posting on LinkedIn from terminal. All right let's see how. that works. I'm going to open the same Chrome developer tools just like how you have been doing through the first HTTP byte. I'm going to go to the network tab quickly copy some text okay all right now let's see I'm going to post it you can see that there are several network calls that have already been made by my browser. I'm going to just like quickly clear them then go post okay you see that it has posted the the new learn by doing journey on LinkedIn okay and you can also note that there is a specific API call that the browser has made okay it's non-shares different uh if you visit different websites let's say you are trying to tweet it's going to have a different API this is defined by LinkedIn okay I'm going to quickly delete this as well for now okay over here if you were to see what we have done it actually started off with the URL it's actually contacting linkedin.com some some main point you don't have to really worry about it it says something like okay content creation no shares it's a POST request earlier what we saw was a GET request right where we were trying to retrieve something from the server now we are trying to POST something to the server alright and the status code also is something slightly different right earlier we saw the same green color but 200 over here you are seeing 201 why because in a POST request what you are trying to do is you are trying to create a resource on the linkedin server right I am creating a POST that's why it shows up as 201 alright and this is something already know from the DNS server we already got the IP of linkedin server and then connecting to port 443 let's move down a bit over here you can see that that as a part of the request payload right whatever I type on the text over here it's all showing up as a part of my request payload right now what I'm going to do is copy this as a curl request ok and I'll just like show confirm with you that you know the post has already been deleted over here let's see ok there are no more posts over here I'm going to go to the linux box that we have just like got and then paste this over here right I have completely pasted the curl request right from my browser over here on the terminal now what do you expect would happen right will it actually create a post on my account or don't will not create a post on my account right let's try it out I'm going to do enter it returns something called 409. Does that mean I can't really do a post from terminal on LinkedIn? Not really. The way learning happens on cryo platform is you have to get into the roots. Correct? So it's giving me something called 409 and I know that if I can Google this then I might find something interesting. So what I am going to do is go to Google and then say HTTP status 409. There is some sort of a message I have over here. It says HTTP 409 conflict indicates that a request conflicts with current state of target resource. It's most likely means that though I deleted the post on LinkedIn server, LinkedIn probably marked it for soft deletion. Okay. What that means is that it has marked it as deleted so that it doesn't show up on my profile. But in real, maybe it has not deleted that post. That is something to do with the internal implementation of LinkedIn. We don't have to care. This status code doesn't mean I can't really create a post from terminal 8 right, you should not be giving up at this point, you should go about debugging this further till you know what is the right answer, all right, that's how you learn on the cryo platform as well right by asking more questions and then digging deeper and more importantly being a better user, all right, so what I am going to do is try changing the text over here okay, because for LinkedIn for some reason thinks that this particular text right, this is already existing in a different post maybe that is why it is not letting me recreate the post, I am going to change this and then try posting it again okay, it's going to be a bit slow because my cursor is moving too slow for me, all right, so let's see, I am here before the and I want to do this post from linux terminal alright ok I'm also going to add a slash in so that it appears clean let's try this seems like some other result has come back from the linkedin server let's go and check it out over here let's refresh the screen alright here we go right there's some jumbling because probably I didn't create the text in the right way okay maybe because I edited it in the command line maybe I missed some spaces but it did actually did it from the linux terminal all right so we were able to mimic whatever the browser did right from the command line and if you want to understand further on how it exactly worked you can go ahead and then finish the byte you'll get a better sense of why it worked right because i'm not sharing my username or password from the terminal but it's still posted on my linkedin account if you have to think a bit deeper about this if i copy or if you copy the same curl command that i have right now if i shared it on with you and then you are going to paste it from any machine in the world it's going to post on my linkedin account and not really yours all right and it has something to do with cookies i would say go ahead understand how this works just like kind of learn things dig things a bit more and then you'll be able to understand things a lot more clearly hope that was interesting posting on linkedin right from your terminal you can do something very similar on twitter uh insta where you want right as long as the particular particular site has some sort of an API essentially you are able to open it from a website and then go do things you can mimic the same exact thing right from the code as well right you can do some fun things with that I hope all of you are going to try something interesting and then share with us as well all right that's about it hopefully you found that interesting and our goal for for you by the end of HTTP byte is that if tomorrow in any interview you are asked this question as to hey what happens when somebody visits cryo.do in a browser or google.com in the browser right you answer this question so very well because you had so much of hands-on exercises in and around every part of the HTTP protocol right the interior is just like completely mesmerized and then feels that you are the best candidate he has ever interviewed right I hope you won't let us down and then said very very high target for yourself all right have a great time coding and see you all on slack and we are looking for a great week ahead of us for the stage one hope to chat with you more on the slack channel as well as in the next sessions all right thank you so much have a great day then bye"

That's what we call here in marketing. But anyway, I hope you've seen the video. It's called Doubts are Inevitable. This particular series, when we thought about it, actually came from one person's life experiences and how they shared it with us. The moment they shared it with us is when we were thinking, wow, this must be what it feels like to be a cryo learner, right? That's how this all came about. So, our first video for Doubts are Inevitable 2, despite the doubts, is out. So, we can take a look at it, but we have a very special guest today. Our guest is none other than Shubhdeep Das, who is the inspiration for this video. Shubhdeep, would you like to introduce yourself? Hello, hello. I'm Shubh. I am Shubhdeep Das. I am from Chhattisgarh and I did my engineering from VIT and then I did this cryo course and got placed in Bangalore and I am having a great time and all thanks to cryo. And I am very excited. Absolutely, I am so excited to watch the video though. You have not seen it yet, no? No, no, no. I have not. It's been out for a couple of days. It just took time and we told Shubhdeep, please don't watch it. We want to see you watch it. So, that's what we have here. So, what do you say Shreya? Let's see it. Beep, beep, beep. Doubts are inevitable, but it's what you do despite them that really matters. Mr. Shabdeeb, the... Cryo for the people who do. Yeah, man. Yeah. It's so good. It's really good, man. It's really good. Thank you. We were really excited to show you because yeah, a lot of these points I know some of them are like some of those doubts are common like anybody would feel it but some of them are like very specific to you. Yeah. What do you have to say about those things? I actually felt those things while I was preparing and doing it. It really, it was really translated well. I really loved the whole cinematography and the way the whole thing played out. It was really great. It was really great. I loved it. Thank you for being a great spokesperson for us as well. Yeah. Every time I hear your story, it's just amazing. Yeah. Thank you so much. All the best for your future. Thank you so much. Learn by doing. Yeah, absolutely. That's something I learned very quickly."

        "transcription": "everyone welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem minimum difference between two array elements we are given or what we have to say is we are given an array of integers what we need to do we need to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array given array of integers pick two elements whose difference is minimum which are closest elements so that the difference will be the least possible value and whatever that least possible difference is we have to print that so a very simple test case is given actually in the sample input there are three elements the elements are one two and four and what we need to do we need to find the difference between two elements which is minimum so when you say the difference between one and two it will be only one difference between two and four it will be two difference and when it comes to one and four it will be three difference There are only three pairs possible in this array. What is the minimum among them? The minimum among them will be the difference one. That's why the output is one, which is two minus one. So this was a very simple test case, but there might be more elements and it is not given in the question that elements will be in the sorted order. It can be unsorted. Also, it can be random order. No where it is mentioned that array will be in particular order. So there are at most almost 10 to the power of 6 elements worst case and each element can be or at most you can say almost 10 to the power of 9 the maximum integer value almost. So let's take an example and in fact let's take an unsorted array. Let's take an array containing 20 then let's take 50 then let's take maybe we have next value is 10 next value is 55 next value is let's say 57 or maybe 58. So this is. the array given to us what we need to do is we need to find the minimum difference between any two elements what we can do since array is unsorted one of the brute force which might come to your mind is just run a loop for the first element of the pair run another nested loop for the another element of the pair that is run nested loops one loop for a maybe first element is a one loop for b and check if a and b are having the minimum distance and in such a case if we are having two loops one for a one for b finding all the pairs 20 50 20 10 20 55 20 58 then 50 10 50 55 50 58 10 55 10 58 and finally 55 58 what will be the overall time complexity since we are having nested loops since we are figuring out all the pairs possible it will go worst case as order of n square time where n is the number of array elements because one loop will run for all the elements inner loop will run for first four times then three times and two times and then one time we have to run the inner loop only for the elements after the current element we can't take the same index twice so it will be 1 plus 2 plus 3 up till up till n minus 1 which is n into n minus 1 by 2 which is n square only inverse case so time complexity will be quadratic simply you can say two loops nested loops quadratic time but what about the space you will say there is no extra space required constant space solution because we can just maintain a variable which is minimum difference and find the answer using that simple integer variable 4 bytes but is it the most optimized solution obviously not we can optimize it further actually there are multiple optimizations possible you can solve it using the sorting if you are able to sort the array then as you have seen in the previous example you will never find a difference to be minimum when the elements are very far away that is the main logic why we need sorting the idea behind sorting is once we have this elements in sorted order what will the order become 10 20 50 55 58 10 20 50 55 58 so in this particular order what we will say can ever the minimum distance be between 10 and 50 can it be ever between 10 and 55 10 58 can it be ever between 20 55 20 58 50 58 no it can never be between two elements which are far away which are not the consecutive elements in sorted order it will not be the minimum distance obviously minimum distance will be between two consecutive elements present in the array after being sorted so once the array is sorted what we can say is just compare the adjacent elements present in at the adjacent indices between 10 and 20 distances 10 only between 20 and 50 distances 30 obviously not the minimum between 50 and 55 distances 5 obviously greater cycle lesser distance better answer. And finally, if you will check the distance between 55 and 58, it is only distance of three, which is even lesser. So finally you will say the minimum answer possible is three. The minimum distance between two elements is three. So once you have sorted the array entirely, which will take n log n time. If you are using the best sorting algorithms like quick sort merge sort heap sort these kind of sortings or if you even if you are using the inbuilt sorting inbuilt sorting will also take n log n time. So sorting first in optimized solution, which will take n log n after sorting we are just comparing adjacents by running a simple single loop one loop is required linear loop is required. So just comparing adjacents will be nothing but you can say linear in nature and how many pairs will be there we can say we have to just compare for n minus one pairs. If there is a five side only four pairs need to be compared because only adjacents need to be compared. So n log n plus n. overall time complexity will be the higher one which is n log n 1 only but still you can say it is better than the brute force it is better than n square what about space if we are going to use the inbuilt sorting which will be stable and in place sorting we don't need stable but we need in place sorting so that we are taking no extra space in place sorting means the sorting will happen in the same array so most of the languages provide some inbuilt sorting method which is the in-place algorithm also that is without extra space algorithm also so we are assuming that it will be having constant space solution so n log n time constant space solution for the problem minimum difference between any two array elements with that we are done with the approaches we will write the instruction manual for the optimized approach that is first what we will do is what we need is we need the array to be sorted either in increasing order or in decreasing order by default it is usually increasing so we will say sort array on increasing order using inbuilt function using inbuilt method to sort and hopefully there should be a method in your programming language if not then you can implement the logic any logic maybe quick sort merge sort heap sort anything once the array is sorted what you can do is you can just have a variable create a variable initialize a variable which is an integer answer as the maximum possible value because we have to find the minimum answer so set the answer as maximum possible which you can say is this particular value plus one as this particular value plus one this can be the maximum difference why because the answer will come out with this minus one if there are only two elements one is the minimum possible one is the maximum possible element difference between them will be this minus this that is almost 10 to the power of 9 so we can set it as 10 to the power of 9 plus 1 whatever this value is i think it is 10 to the power of 9 nine now run a loop run a for loop over indices all the indices from zero to the last index no when we are saying we are having zero index as i compare i with i plus one compare i with i plus one compare i with i plus one compare i with i plus one but for the fourth index for n minus one at the index last index of the array there is no i plus one index four plus one will give you five and five is the array dot length and if you will get the element add the arrays length it will give you null pointer error or it will give you a garbage value so better to run the loop only till third index only till n minus second index that is i will run the loop only till n minus two from zero to n minus two or you can say less than n minus one every time compare the distance the difference between array of i with array of i plus one and make it a positive difference that is don't do 10 minus 20. Don't do array of i minus array of i plus 1. It will become negative. You have to do array of i plus 1 minus array of 0 or array of i that is 20 minus 10, 50 minus 20, 55 minus 50. If the array of i array at i plus 1 minus array at i is even lesser than the answer, then what we have to do update the answer, update answer as the same value as the array at i plus 1 minus array at i. And finally, we have to do what we have to do, return that answer variable, whatever the minimum difference we will get. So this is the strategy which we are going to solve, which will take n log n time and space will be constant if we are assuming no extra space inside the sorting logic in place sorting if we are doing. With that, we are done with the third milestone. We have already written the instruction manual. Using that, we will write code in java language first of all how to sort a array of integers or ints in java in increasing order the default sorting is using arrays.sort and it will use temsorter logic which is a combination of merge sort quick sort and insertion sort you can say in average case in worst case it will take n log n time complexity without extra space that too so even though there is extra space it will be very less almost negligible so we can say the arrays.sort function on an array of n length will take n log n time complexity once the array is sorted we know that the minimum difference between two elements will be consecutive elements only because array sorted only consecutive elements will give minimum so we are initializing the answer as the maximum possible value present in the array plus one because the minimum possible value can be one only so the maximum possible difference can be this minus this so we are are initializing it with one greater value or you can also initialize with the maximum integral value the maximum value in the integer range integer dot max value in java but this is also okay once we are able to do it what we will say is that run a loop let me just copy it i am not sure whether i have copied it properly or not let me just make it this particular value now run a loop from indices 0 till n minus 2 that is less than equal to n minus 2 and every time do what compare the current index with the next index what is the difference between those two elements if array of i plus 1 minus array of i the difference between greater minus smaller value if the difference is even lesser than the answer till now the minimum difference till now update the minimum difference update the answer as the same value array of i plus 1 minus array of i same difference a very simple logic a simple for loop after sorting and we can return answer. So nothing much to explain here. Let's just directly run this code and see if it is going to work fine for the sample test case or not. So as you can see we are getting certain error that we can't find a symbol which is error because array name is a only not error. So let us change the array name to error and then again run. Hopefully it should be correct now. There is one more issue. We can't find the symbol I. Okay, so we are running the loop on index but we are using variable I inside the for loop. So let's just change the for loop on I itself known like the variable names were differing inside the loop and inside the you can say the parameters. Now it is working correct sample test case although it is already sorted it is working even though if you take an array which is not sorted initially 412 still it should give me the same distance which is 1 because we are first sorting the array. Let's see if it is giving going to give me one or not. It is taking some time again as you can see it is giving me one even if the corner case is there that is one value is one another value is the maximum possible value there are only two elements hopefully it should give me the correct output that is the maximum possible value minus one that is a lot of nines should be there in the output. So as you can see it is correct even for the corner case let's submit it and see if it is going to work for all the test cases or not. And all the 10 test cases base cases corner cases are working as expected the time complexity as already discussed due to sorting n log n then a loop n n log n plus n is n log n only in worst case what about the space complexity since in java arrays.sort do not take any extra space or you can say very negligible extra space is taken the space complexity will be constant in place solution we are able to do however we are taking n log n time. One follow up which you can take from this problem is can you try to do this problem using some other approach although it might be of the same time complexity but using some other approach maybe by using binary search if you know about binary search. So that will be one follow up but till then bye bye take care."

        "transcription": "In this video, we are going to learn about what is the actual representation of how values are getting stored with the variables. Are there any containers in which these values get stored? How is the memory management going on? And what exactly is the thing behind when we say variables are named containers? So variables are not any values or there are no containers as such which are holding these values. This concept can be very well understood by this animation in front of you. So let's say we had a variable which was declared with the identifier let. So we are saying let pet equals to narwhal. So pet was simply referring to the value narwhal in the beginning. Once the reassignment has been done, this pet variable will simply start referring to the new value which is the Kraken. So basically the thing that we have to understand over here is that there are no such containers like pet or something which are. actually storing those values. It is simply a referring game over here. Pet in the initial time was referring to narwhal. After some time when the reassignment is done, it starts referring to the value the krigin. And what happens to the value narwhal? This is simply going to be removed from the memory. Okay, so variables are not the actual values. Variables are simply pointing to the values. Okay, at whatever memory address this value must be stored, the variable is simply going to point to that. Okay, so that is the reason once it has been reassigned to the krigin narwhal as wherever it is stored in the memory is simply going to be removed from the memory. So that is the reason we say variables are not values variable simply point to the values. We are going to learn about some naming conventions of variables that we need to take care of. So here's a question in front of you. Can we name a variable as 12 underscore number? That is var 12 underscore number. Think about it guys. Take a pause and think about it. Can you name your variables like this? Well, the correct answer is no, you cannot be naming your variables as this. A valid variable name should always start with a letter or an underscore or a dollar sign. These are the only three set of characters which are allowed in terms of starting a variable name. So let me give you an example on Repl.it as well. Let's clear all of this. Now, if you have to simply make any variable name, a valid variable name can start with a letter like an A or a B or a C, A, B, C, X, Y, Z, whatever you would like to have. You can also have an underscore A or you can also have a dollar A. All of these use cases are going to be allowed, but you cannot be saying one A. A valid variable name can only start with a letter underscore or a dollar. It cannot start with a number. But yes, after you have initialized it with a letter, you can of course use any number as well. Okay. You can also say var a12 equals to 12. Okay. That is completely fine, but it cannot start with a digit as such. Okay. So this is something that we need to take care of. Also after the first letter, you can use numbers, letters, underscores or any dollar signs. Also can you name your variable as a const? Can you say something like var const equals to five? Think about it again, make a pause. Well, again, the correct answer is going to be no, we cannot be naming our keywords or our variables as the reserved keywords. So basically a valid variable name cannot be a reserved keyword of JavaScript. What are reserved keywords? Any keyword which is going to be used in the syntax of JavaScript programming language is simply going to be known as a reserved keyword. Since const is also used under the syntax, since it is a valid identifier, you cannot be using that keyword as our variable names. So what is the thing we have learned up till now? Your valid variable names should only start with letter, underscore and a dollar sign and it should not be a reserved keyword of JavaScript."

In Cryo, they have embraced the learn by doing methodology at its core. You learn code by writing code yourself. I found about Cryo, I went through their website and their entire curriculum. The way it was designed, the projects are pretty amazing. So, I believe the way the course has been structured kind of also helps you to shape your mentality in a way how you approach a program and just write good code in the end of the day. When I joined Cryo, methodology changed. When I see a problem statement now, I don't directly jump into a solution. I try to break down the problem in small parts, come up with a brute force approach and then find better optimized solution. For that, one of the biggest decision-makers for me for joining Cryo was this projects too. Because these projects are quite unique, you wouldn't find it anywhere else and very close to the real-world projects. I felt like I became a better developer and also it added a lot of plus points in my resume too for recruiters and hiring managers."

Well actually, well actually, be very clear with her. Undo in real life. Please undo in real life. Well, actually... Well, you cannot undo in real life. But let's say you're creating an artwork using a program like Photoshop or MS Paint. An undo and redo feature becomes an essential tool for perfecting your artwork. This feature is powered by a data structure called stack which functions on last-in-first-out principle. Every action you take like adding a stroke, a color or a shape is like placing the new plate on top of the undo stack. So when you press undo, you're basically moving the top plate from the undo stack and moving it to the top of the redo stack. Now if you decide to redo your action, then you pop the top plate from the redo stack and push it to the top of the undo stack. So next time when you mess up in real life, remember, you don't have a real-life stack to undo your actions."

So, I had gone through the whole journey of, you know, starting from zero of arrays, tags, queues, etc. Right? And going until like graphs, TPA. So did you do lead code and all? Yeah, I did do that. I had to rank and lead code, I mean, mix match. But then I understood it's a journey, right? It's not about that you have to code and then you have to, you know, mug up how the problem are solving.

A lot of times actually by asking a couple of why's, you may actually even avoid building something. They don't just keep building something which is not required. And second, a lot of good developers kind of try to understand the overall context in which this particular feature or a product is going to operate. Business context and the system context, right? A lot of times actually they provision for what is going to come, right? And if you're going to work with a good engineer, right?

So for me as well, it is the first event that I am ever attending and like I am even excited that there are a lot of people who even I don't know and you know they have been working with different companies so it will be good and exciting to meet them. I hope you guys have a great time. Can you tell us a full form of CAN looking at the camera? It will be cryo alumni. What do I? You didn't know? Now you know it."

Your Google Maps, you are looking at how to get to a place, you're able to understand which place is crowded, which place is not. So this is AI in play. You use your chatbot, your virtual agents when you log into a particular portal. This is AI, again, in everyday use. If you come to manufacturing, we can do things like, you know, predictive maintenance, where you prevent outages, saving a lot of dollars and a lot of money for the companies and enterprises. It can drastically change. You can probably detect a heart attack. before it's happening. You have, we already have people wearing devices and tracking all these things.

How are actually all these calls being made and how we are all, you know, connected that way. Suppose on your terminal, everyone must have done ping google.com, right? So where it will show you which all locations your entire, that entire communication house where all servers it has touched so that you can see that google.com on your screen, right? So it is kind of like, it's what makes the internet. It's what connects all of us. And not just the internet, you have private data centers which companies use or, you know, like in-house, like a lot of financial, bank, insensitive information, they do not have, they do not put it on AWS or something on cloud. So they have their private data centers. So what I was into was the product. So we, initially I was working on the storage side of it. Cisco MDS switches, which was building the storage area network. So there you have an initiator and a target. And in between there is, so the target is basically you call LUNs, where the storage, actually the data is stored. So initiator is basically just a server. Server, it connects to a storage area network. So when you have a huge network, like your hard disk is something you have, you can just, like a limited amount of storage. So in a storage area network, what happens is that you need that flexibility, because you don't know how much storage you're going to consume. So that's what I was working on initially, that storage side of it. But data center has three aspects. So one is storage, one is network, and one is compute. So compute is the LAN side. You must have studied like TCP, IP in college, like ethernet side. So that is what I did next in my next internal transition. Then now what I'm doing, I joined this team in November. We are working on the compute, that is the server side. So we have Cisco UCS servers. I work on a product called Cisco Intercite, which manages the entire server. On that, I'm working on a specific feature. But yeah, so what happened with each internal transition is that I wanted to understand how the internet works. How are actually all these calls being made and how we are all connected that way."

I mean, the full course I joined. I mean, all the things like DSA and system design and all those things I have learned during the Cryo one week. The DSA part was very good. I mean, the optimal solution I was able to find after doing all the DSA. So that I have, I have improved a lot. I mean, learning content, it was good. Awesome. I mean, if you say that, I can, was good. I mean, the modules that were open, that was no very, very, I mean, you go through the basics and then you use the example to implement my coding. It's just got improved. I got, you know, more fluent in writing the code. I used to see from Google, but after doing, I can write on my own without seeing any syntax error or those things like there is a lot to gain.

I went through them, then I implemented those things into my project. So I got to learn in a very arranged and a proper manner. The projects were very well directed. Those are projects which are very much related to the industry experience. So you get to learn about how to figure out things on your own. If you're not able to figure out, then you get to the mentors. They were really cooperative with everything. If you get stuck, you are always provided with every sort of help you need.

        "transcription": "Cryo helped me a lot in the way I structure my projects, whether it is a personal project or let's say, currently I'm working a job. So the way I code has certainly changed. The projects, the micro experiences were pretty well crafted. Every single module of these projects is aimed to increasing difficulty in a specific way and to teach a very particular thing while coding. Even a beginner who just started with the language or just knows the basics is able to go ahead and learn step by step. Cryo did have a very different methodology from all the other tutorials. So to be quite frank, I'm not the person who can sit through video tutorials. I would completely doze off or read through books. It was pretty close to what an actual development cycle in a company would go. Learning... To solve a problem in a development environment is a very different thing, right? When you actually try to build something using libraries, you need to read a lot. And that is a habit that Cryo kind of tried to inculcate in those who are taking them experiences. I don't think any other platform until now does that. And apart from that, Cryo was there to help me when I was not able to solve a problem. But it made sure that I'm not being fed answers directly. So that was also a huge plus point. Cryo did make me code in a structured, in a proper way, abiding to the correct guidelines and the best practices. So that is something that I noticed going forward with the modules and even the projects. And apart from that, one thing that was profound for me was data structure track. So like the problem solving methodology that I learned was quite. different. Competitive coding is one thing that people strive really hard for. But what people don't realize is that fundamentals are the most important thing. Every question can have a certain variation. So if you know the fundamentals, and you have them by heart, you can solve that variation just by a simple tweak in the code. So that is something that Cryo really helped me with. That is structured problem solving, structural problem solving, structural code writing, these two are different for reasons that you would understand once you take the experience. One thing that I would definitely like to pass along is that don't try to find an easy way out when you're solving experience, micro experiences. Because that was, that is something that you're really tempted to do when you're stuck for too long. But keep trying, fight the problem for as long as you can until you finally give up. Actually, if you fight the problem enough you actually remember the solution for longer. Sometimes what happens is you can't solve it today but tomorrow when you open it then you then the solution suddenly clicks in so that's something and yeah I guess apart from that I would say that focus on the fundamentals and spend more time on it which is not what many people do so I guess yeah that would be pretty much from my side."

        "transcription": "Now, we will try to understand switch in Java. What is exactly switch? So switch is also a conditional similar to our if-else. It is also a conditional. Now why we have two conditionals? We already have if-else, then why Java has given us switch? So in these scenarios, right, where we have more than five conditions, let's say we have multiple conditions. Let's take a problem statement only. Let's say you are supposed to figure out if this particular alphabet is vowel or not. So in this particular case, you will write, let's say your variable is char ch is equal to a. Now, in this particular scenario, you would write your code something similar to this. If ch is equal. to A. You will print it's a vowel something like that. Similarly, you will write multiple cases. If A is equal to AEIOU for all the vowels you will write this. You will have multiple conditions right for all the vowels AEIOU and at last in else you will write ok print. It is not a vowel. So in this particular use case, we will end up writing multiple conditions. We will have more than five conditions. Yes. So whenever you have more than five conditions, it is suggested from the Java side to go with switch. Why we should go with switch because it saves some time the time for calculation right or the time for computation. computation in Java is lesser in the case of switch. If you have multiple conditions, so for that benefit, you should go with switch else. You can solve this problem with if else also it should not matter. Okay, so we have understood the switch what exactly is the use of switch and what is switch exactly now, let's try to get comfortable with the syntax of switch. In case of switch rate, you will have your variable. One variable will be there on top of that. You will write your conditions. So let's retain our previous code and we will convert same to switch. So first of all, you will have switch keyword. Switch keyword. Now in this particular round bracket, you should have your expression. Expression basically means on top of which variable you want to write your condition. So basically we want to write condition on top of ch, right? So we will replace that with CH later on you will have your expression and then you will define the scope of switch scope of switch is defined with curly bracket. Now, you need to compare this CH variable with multiple alphabets. For example, a e i o u so everything will become a case. Everything will become a case. For example, it will be case a. Then a colon symbol and statement to be executed. So basically you will write case a then colon symbol and after that statement to be executed. So whenever your case is true, this particular statement will be executed. Now, we have written only one case, right? Similarly, you will have multiple cases k a e. I owe you like that. Now, if none of these cases holds true, let's say none of these cases were true. I have given value as B. If my character is B, it is not alphabet. So none of these cases will hold true. So for that we have a default default is similar to your else. If nothing is executed, it will always execute default and inside default. You will have some set of statement to execute. This is the overall syntax of your switch. Let's convert. We will convert our vowel example only to a program. Now, let's try to do that. For that, I'll create a method. Let's say public string. Vowel switch. And then we need to have our character rate. Catch variable on top of which we will write our switch case. So the very first keyword is your switch. Switch. Our expression has to be CH because on top of this we want to write our cases. So you will write case a. We can have a return statement return. Since it is a vowel we will return it's a vowel. Similarly, let's complete the program for all the cases. AE I O Ou O and you. Now this is done. We also need to have a default default. We will say okay. This is a consonant. Now we have created our method. Let's call this method now. Let's pass the value as let's pass the value of E. So E is a vowel right? So what will happen in this case since you have passed E? What will happen in this case? Okay. Ch will be passed as E. Ch is equal to E. Ch is equal to E. It will go to first case. It will check. Okay. Is A equal to E? Is this correct? A is the current case. Is A equal to E? No, this is not correct. It will go to second case and it will validate. Is E equal to E? Yes, this is true. So vowel E will be returned and same thing should be printed. Now we will run our code to validate our answer. Okay. Yes. So we are able to execute our program and get the predicted output in this particular scenario, right? We have used return type. Let's make our method void. Let's make our method void and we will try to print then and there itself. Let's modify the logic instead of return. We will print here only. Ideally, you should give us same output. That's what we will understand. Anyone who will look at this code, they will think that okay ideally it should give same value. that instead of printing outside and printing it in the method itself. Okay, ideally it should give us value as E but we will run our program and validate. What do we notice? Okay, whenever it found a matching case after that it has executed each and every statement, right? Yes. So whenever it found a matching case, it was able to execute each and every case right after that. So first we will try to. understand why it has happened. Your switch case is actually fall through your switch case is fall through you need to have a terminating statement. So when I say fall through it basically means whenever it will find a matching case, right? It will execute everything else after that until unless you specifically tell it to stop. So in last example, when we used return return will exit the method from then and there itself. Okay, let's let's do a dry run and we will try to understand what well is equal to E CH is equal to E. Is a equal to E? No, this was false. So it will go to second case is equal to E. Yes, this is true. Since it found a matching case, right? What will happen? It will execute all the cases after that until unless you force your program to exit. So in last example, we had a return statement return will forcefully ask your program to exit from there and go to the main method. So it will exit from the vowel switch method and go to your main method because of return statement, but here do we have a return statement? No, since you don't have a return statement, right? It is executing other cases. We have understood the problem statement now. Yeah, but what is the solution for that the solution to it is break keyword break. So break actually helps you to break the current flow of execution when I see current flow of execution your line number 9 isn't it inside the line number 7 curly bracket. Isn't it inside the line number 7 curly bracket? Yes. So whenever it will encounter a break, right? It will only exit from line number 21. And the control will come back to line number 22. I'll repeat myself. I repeat myself it will exit the switch and come out to line number 22 it will not exit the method. So that is the difference between break and return in case of return it will exit the method in case of break it will only exit the current flow of control. So the current flow of control was switch. So it will exit that particular switch. So ideally your line number 22 print statement should be printed right? That's what we understand. It will exit from line number 12 because of break if you will write break in all the lines it will exit and it should ideally come to outside switch print statement. We will go ahead run our program to validate this. So we are able to get the predicted output. This is what we predicted with the help of dry run and same thing. We are able to validate also. Now, let's solve a problem. We have solved two problems on replete. Now we will try to solve one problem on the cryo-crypt tool. Thank you for watching. Okay, so let me give a brief about the problem statement first given the day of a week as a number from 1 to 7. Okay. So the input given to us to this method is in today. So the day value has to be between 1 and 7 right return the corresponding weekday. For example, if day is equal to 1 it will be Monday days equal to 2 will be Tuesday days go to 3 when is day Thursday Friday Saturday something like that and 7 will be your Sunday. But if someone will enter any other value from 1 to 7, we have to return invalid. We all understood the problem statement. So let's take an example. If someone has given input as 5 days equal to 5 what should be your output Friday, but let's say if someone will give an input as 10 is 10 among 1 to 7. No, so your output has to be invalid. Yeah, so this is basically. the problem statement. Let's try to solve it with the switch. So the very first thing is to create a switch with day. So day will be our variable or expression. Now, we will write all the cases case one. Case one has to be Monday. Tuesday. Similarly, we will do it for other cases. Let me make an let me copy it so that it's easy for me to type. Case three will be Monday. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Case 5 will be Friday. Then case 6 will be Saturday. Then lastly case 7. Sunday. And after you're done with all the cases, you will have a default which is invalid. Let's run this and validate. Yes, so we are able to submit our program and validate the correctness of it. So this basically completes our discussion around switch and some examples associated with that. Thank you."

First, actually, I choose the fellowship program of Cryo, in which both the DSA and Java part. First couple of months, it's a basic Java lessons. And after that basic DSA lessons, and it really helps me a lot. The DSA makes you capable of tackling with the question. I mean, how to solve a question, example, how to solve a real world problem. So DSA helps me with that. It really helps me a lot to gain perspective of how the development project work in a company. I mean, it would take me days, I mean, to think about how some projects is going to work, how we are going to solve the problem and all that. But if I keep doing it and doing it, I've got. really well in DSA and Java part and that's the best thing Cryo could ever done to anyone by doing the project. About a year ago and when I look back and I have seen that I don't have any skills so I was working in a support project and in support project your skill won't increase. I mean you are stuck at a place where you were earlier and it was really tough for me so I tried to switch my project from there.

I have completed my Bachelors of Technology degree in Computer Engineering. Currently, I am an Associate Software Engineer at Webile Lab. I am working there as a Backend Engineer. Becoming the Cryo alumni, it feels really proud to me. Like two to three opportunities in just a short period of time of six months only. When I thought about Cryo, so the most important point for me was, first point was the structured way of learning. Then the second point was the excellent mentors. Like I knew the mentors here are like, they are actually working in the industry. So it won't be like the faculty of our colleges, where they don't have the actual industry experience. But in here, in Cryo, the mentors are like working in the industry. So like they have the idea about the current trends and technologies out there. That was the second point. The third point was, I knew that there will be a peer around me who will be as much excited as I will be. The fourth one was, every person from the cryo team, everyone was really helpful. Like, when I was talking with them for the first time, they were really friendlier. And every person from cryo team, they were really helpful, they were really nice to me. Just not to me, to everyone. That was also one of the key points which I got from the cryo personally. The mentors were really close to me. They were just friends to me. I got to learn a lot of things from them. Not just about technology part. They were like the tech giants, you can say. They were best at their field. So I got to know a lot of things from them about the technology. But not just about tools and technologies. I got to learn more than just technical things from there. Like the way they used to interact with every person out there. Suppose there are 30 persons, then the mentor used to try to talk with every person out there. They used to try to solve the problems which anyone could have. That was a really great experience for me. I remember the most important thing is to like set your goals properly. But I was providing everything. So like if we follow the resources provided by them, the guidance provided by a person, then yeah it would be really easy for us to grab the opportunity.

And in just three months, guys, three months, he completed the program and in just one week from completion, he secured a job at Edufund. How amazing is that? Jeevraj, I know you're here today. Would you like to say a couple of words on this victory? Yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah. Thanks for this award, especially. And I'd like to give special thanks to two people from Cryo. One is Latish and the other is Rachel. Like Latish was very helpful throughout my journey during my referral thing. I remember that day when I joined Cryo and I wanted to decide that how can I complete this sprint within a very short time. So, I raised the ticket on Cryo and it was Rachel on the opposite side. She told me, OK, you need to do this sprint and you will be eligible for referral. I was like, OK, I don't want to learn back and right now. I just want to focus on front end. Rachel told me that just by front end, you can get job. do that first. So, because of that, I planned my sprint and I was able to complete it within three months. And I was it was a surprise for me to get the job within first week. But I think those who are right now in that phase that they are on the completion or want to get the job, I would like to say that this journey is not easy and it is very frustrating. And if you are getting frustrated for solving very small things, even it happens many times that you are spending two days for debugging. And at the end, you realize that it's just a small question mark or a small, a small letter, which was creating a problem in your code. If you are in that phase, trust me, it is that phase when you are about to crack your job. That is what is required. And be honest about yourself. Trust the process of cryo you are going to get job you are getting we are getting so many referrals. Initially, when I joined cryo, I was like when I will start getting a referral. And when I started getting referrals before, like eligibility, we were like we were getting one referral per week. week and so I was like so less reference and when I was eligible for reference I was like oh my god so many reference I was literally frustrated by shortlisting I was like so many shortlisting it was not just reference but it was also lots of shortlisting within a one week so that one week that last week where I when I got the placement it was not easy and a time came when I was able to create completed project within just two to three hours I think that three months period made me such a way that completing the project within three to four hours I think is the achievement so trust the process and whatever cryo curriculum is designed in such a way that whatever we did during cryo I am doing the same thing in company also I did not got the job initially I got the internship and during internship we were four interns who were selected I was from cryo and other three from like other places out of four interns only one was selected for full time and that was me so that was possible only because the cryo curriculum and the on job situation was similar for me nothing was new i was doing the same thing which i used to do it in cryo so i think that helped me a lot to convert my internship to ppo and uh thanks thanks a lot for that and whatever i did it was all for my daughter uh you can see on pic uh i'm uh carrying a water bottle it is also for of my daughter only so whenever you see me or any photo you'll always see something related to my daughter so it was all for her thank you thank you very much thank you what a what a lucky little princess your daughter is so inspirational and somebody in the audience audience rightfully said if awesome has a face this is it then we do believe that all right thank you thank you jeeva"

        "transcription": "I was working from about 2021 as assistant system engineer trainee at TCS. During joining Cryo, I was looking for a development role in which I can grow and it got me a really good opportunity. I learned many new things and many new techniques like to do. Like for example, data structures are problem solving, new technique, how to solve problems, like I've learned very well. Many design patterns I learned there. And in QV, I learned Spring Boot and MongoDB, like how we use this MongoDB in our project. Like I learned a lot. I found a very good change in my approach, how to think a problem. That was the main thing I was facing. That was the thing I was facing from a long time and how to solve problems because I was not very good at problem solving, but after Cryo, I was able to solve problems because my instructors taught me like how to approach in a problem. That was the thing I was lacking. Before joining Cryo, I had a lack on my development skills. was very less. After cryo it fulfilled all those skills. Those projects like what we did, small small pieces we have did in the project and they give confidence and then that gives you a huge boost."

Yeah, I think if I just look ahead, right, I think there are a couple of things. Of course, the overall JNI and LLMs are definitely a huge platform shift. I think it could be, I don't know, it's as fundamental as internet, but it is definitely bigger than what cloud, what mobile has brought to the tech scene, I would say. And if you just look at last year, it's primarily a lot of buzz, people are playing around with it. I'm sure the applications of it and pure adoption actually will start coming in the coming years. years right I think it will definitely change almost all industries right all existing products will definitely evolve right I think that's from the technology and platforms with perspective but if you just look at overall markets for tech right I would say if you just look at India I think we're just starting right I think e-commerce has seen probably one way but I think if you still look at our e-commerce penetration in Indian retail is like sub 10 percentage right I think we're just scratching the surface right and if you look at financial markets right I think I think if I remember right I think even less than 1% people are in in markets right I think every every every industry segment has a lot of opportunities right right I think and with continuous 6-7% economic growth I would say if you just look ahead in next 10 years I'm sure there are a lot of domestic consumption, right. I think a lot of opportunity for big consumer opportunities, right. On the other hand, I think India has huge tech talent, right. I think it's only second to US. I think you're going to become almost largest developers in probably like I think five six years from now, right. I think which opens up a lot of opportunities for export. Already Indian IT services is the largest white-collar job in India. And we are largest exporters across the globe, right. And I think if you look at now Indian SaaS companies are actually started becoming meaningful, right. I think Freshworks has gone IPO. We have like Zoho and multiple other companies are actually becoming hundred million dollar plus companies, right. I think I'm very very bullish about Indian tech scene for next decade, right. I think we are going to see the probably peak next, I would say in the coming decade, right. The kind of talent depth we have and domestic opportunities we have. I'm very very bullish about it. in the coming decade for India."

        "transcription": "I was actually a bit worried about my placement and career. I basically thought about upskilling myself, gaining some knowledge about software development. I'm Rajul Shrivastava, born and brought up in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh and my degree was the Bachelor of Technology. After that, in my seventh semester basically, I joined Cryo. When my fourth year was approaching, I felt the need of basically upskilling myself because I don't have much skills in me to showcase in my resume at that time and the curriculum in the college was not basically up to the mark of the industry standards. Basically in the college, we were not properly guided enough. The knowledge was basically widespread and I was not able to clarify to me only at what is best for me. I felt the need that I should basically join Cryo. The basic challenge was I was being introduced to many, many different and new technologies which I haven't even heard of before and they were very advanced technologies also and learning them basically was a big challenge for me because I haven't even heard of them before. before. So basically, from identifying the needs for that technology till implementing it in our code, that was itself a challenge. But that was a very great challenge because if I didn't know something, Acryo helped me a lot from learning each and every technology right from the very basic level to the advanced level so that I can use each and every technology which I have learned. I mean, basically, our mentors were absolutely very, very, very supportive. And no matter how many times I ask my doubts or I can basically get any assistance for each and every doubt, Cryo was very, very helpful in solving all my doubts. And after learning the qualitative technologies, I was able to implement them in my projects as well. In our journey also, I was not basically feeling well. I had a very low point in my life because some problems happened with me. So I was not feeling very well. I basically contacted one of our mentors, which was Shivam Gupta, and he helped me a lot and he guided me very well and to come out of that time. So apart from my curriculum, the guidance from him was very very valuable to me and he was able to basically instill great confidence in me. That moment was basically a very a game-changer moment for me and I am very thankful for him. To all the mentors basically I am very thankful all of them and what I am today I mean it's a completely 180 degree turnaround for me because I am a very confident person. I am basically now I can call myself as a back-end developer. I mean the first thing I would like to all the future learners is first never lose your hope and always keep believing in yourself because that belief is the most important thing that you can have in you. You may feel low at many points in your life but never lose hope. Keep working hard because at the end you will get the rewards of whatever hard work you have done because the fruit of your hard work can be delayed but it should not be denied."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back, in this particular video we will be discussing the problem linked list search. We are given a linked list that is some linear nodes arranged in form of a singly linked list and a target element x. So given that x what we have to do is we have to find if there exists a node in the linked list with data equal to x or not. In the entire linked list is there any node with the data x if yes then most probably we have to return true if not then we have to return false and how I am sure I can read the second line to be sure what the output format is so input and output both are handled by the main function we do not have to do in anything about the main function we only have to do what we only have to implement the function which is given in the code editor or you can say we will be given some input as parameters as arguments and we have to give the output as a return type from the function so structure of linked list will again be given to you you do not have to create a linked list already linked list will be given as an input and structure is given in comments most probably so we do not have to change anything in the structure of the linked list and also rest of the code should not also be changed it should be the same it only and only the function which we have to implement should be added the lines of code should be added in it so input format there will be three lines of input containing n number of elements in the linked list or number of nodes then n space separated integers containing the nodes of the linked list and it will automatically form the linked list in the main function we do not have to do anything that is if there are five nodes containing value one two three four five so all of these nodes will be created and the head node of the linked list will be coming to us and the target x is a two that is we have to search whether two is present or not so answer is true yes two is true the target two is present so we have to print true if the target is present otherwise print false as we have already discussed constraints will be n can range from minimum one node at least there will be at least one node in the linked list linked list cannot be empty in this constraint according to this constraint and maximum the number of nodes can go up till up till 200 in nature and what is the solution which we are going to propose for linked list search do we already know how to search on a array or maybe a linear array kind of thing or maybe we can say a dynamic array the answer is most probably you might have learned various kind of searching algorithms like there might be a linear search algorithm there might be a binary search algorithm so in this particular problem i am making a simple linked list with random nodes with random data actually so these are all the nodes and obviously last node will be having the next pointer as null let's assume this is node with address 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 it means 1000 dot next will be 2000 2000 dot next will be 3000 and up till up till 5000 dot next will be null that is it will be the last node the tail node and obviously we are given the head pointer of the singly linked list as the parameter as the input parameter so if i take the target as maybe 50 if i take the target as 50 is 50 present in this linked list the answer is yes there is a node with value 50 so what we have to do in this case we have to print true or we can say return true but what if the target is not 50 what if the target is let's suppose 45 is 45 present no in the entire linked list 45 is not present so in this case case we have to actually print false can there be multiple nodes with same data yes there can be even if let's suppose this is not 40 even if let's suppose this is 20 only and if the question is that target is 20 is 20 present answer will be of course yes 20 is not only present but it is present for multiple number of times but still answer is true the question is not right now count the occurrences it is only just find whether there is occurrence or not so it does not matter whether a target is present zero times in that case it will be false or one time in that case it will be true or multiple times still it will be true so it doesn't matter whether the elements are duplicate or not answer will remain same but the important point is in arrays we learned about two algorithms as we discussed linear search which will linearly iterate on all the array element and search which element index is having basically equal to the target value or the second approach was given the array was in sorted order given the array was in increasing order we can also apply binary search but since currently the linked list is given first of all there might be a chance that binary search is not possible but surely what we can say is since the data is not sorted it can be in random pattern there is nothing related to sorted data so binary search is ruled out completely because for binary search the data should be sorted so only and only one algorithm remain which is linear search algorithm so we will be doing a linear search it means we will be going to each and every node of the linked list and ask whether that node is having the data equal to target or not so let's just first do the traversal for target 50 what I will do I will start the traversal from root node or actually the head node so head node is a first node of the linked list so let's say we are traversing using a pointer named as current starting from head itself current will be asking is current.data is it equal to 50 target no 10 is not equal to 50 okay let's go to the next node but in array we used to go to the next node by jumping the index 0 becomes 1 1 becomes 2 in case of linked list we will go to the next node by actually making current is equal to current.next that is 1000.next which will become actually 2000 again ask the same thing is 2000.data that is current.data is it equal to the target 50 no again current is equal to current.next which is 3000 is the current.data is equal to target again no it is 50 the target is actually 50 but the node is 20 go to the next node as soon as I will go to the next node 4000.data or current.data will be equal to the target 50 so yes we can say return true so for the target 50 we were searching and we started from root node or the head node and we went till the fourth node in the linked list in worst case what if let's suppose the last node was 50 or maybe 60 and the target was itself 60 in that case we have to travel to each and every node because target will be present at last node or even if the search is unsuccessful let's do a try and for search unsuccessful for 45 I will say is the target equal to the current node data no we will start from head node obviously go to the next node is 30 equal to target 45 no go to the next node is current.data equal to target 45 no current.next is 50 equal to 45 no current is equal to current.next is 20 equal to 45 no current is equal to current.next and as soon as the current reaches null can we say that the linear search is done we are not able to find the target so it is a unsuccessful search so as soon as the target is not found it means we can just simply return false and where is target not found as soon as the current pointer reaches null in this case obviously it was successful search and the try run will be very much similar for multiple elements only the case is as soon as the first occurrence of target is found 20 is first occurrence is found we will return true because we do not care whether there are more occurrences of 20 or not in this particular question so we are actually searching for the first time the target element is appearing in the link list what will be the time complexity for this particular question since for successful search worst case we can go till the last node so order of n because each and every node traversal will require constant time but for how many times n times if there are n number of nodes and even for the unsuccessful search also we are going to each and every node jumping by one one position so that will also be linear what about the space complexity will we require any extra space to solve this problem will there be any auxiliary data structure actually no only input traversal is required so input data structure is already created we will not include the space used by link list itself link list is a input we never include input space or output space in space complexity space complexity means auxiliary data structure extra data structures which we are creating so that is nothing constant extra space so with that we are done with the second milestone that is actually finalizing the approach using a linear search algorithm now we will be writing the instruction manual in the milestone number three so first of all let's initialize a node a list node current starting from head starting from head starting as head we will travel the current pointer we will make the current pointer travel on the link list till the point one till the point either the target is found or the target is not found and the complete link list is searched that is unsuccessful search so in the loop what we have to provide should we provide the successful search scenario no successful search scenario can only be checked if data is compared so we can't compare data if we are not sure whether node is null or not what do you mean by that if let's say node is null can you get null dot data no if node is not null then only you can get the data so better will be first check for whether the node is null or not so we will run the while loop run a while loop only till until we can say the current pointer is not a null node as soon as it reaches null we have to stop if it is not null now we can actually check whether it is equal to the target or not so if the currents current nodes data currents data is equal to target then what we have to do is target is nothing but x what we have to do is we have to say return true yes found target found linear search successful but if target is not found at the current node let's go to the next node by instead of doing index plus plus what should we do we actually should basically go to the next node by jumping the current pointer as the currents next pointer currents next node the current should be updated as set current as what set current as currents next node so currents next node but if this while loop runs entirely and the current pointer reaches null in null node what we have to return if the current is reaching null it means target was never found and if target is never found outside the loop after the loop we will say return false target not found this is target not found a scenario unsuccessful search scenario so simple enough instruction manual with four five lines of code that's it once you know the approach once you know the instruction manual each line by line then we can easily code it in your preferred programming language right now we are choosing Java to code it so what we are going to do is first of all we are going to use a pointer to iterate on the link list the pointer name can be anything I am naming it as current pointer starting it as head so we will be starting the iteration from the head node only because we have to always travel in the forward direction we only have to travel till the point current is not null so current not equal to null only till that point we have to run the for loop because if current reaches null we cannot compare the data if this loop ends finally we can say return something so for now just let's return false because it is mentioned also that if the loop ends it means current reaches null and if current reaches null the target is not found so return false let's also just run this code before writing anything inside the while loop let's see what will happen actually it will go into an infinite loop why because while loop will never terminate it will always say current is not null so it will always run the loop and at one particular point of time it will go into infinite iteration or you can say a runtime error so actually it is going to give a timeout or you can the time limit exited but if I actually go to the next node by jumping the current pointer making it current.next let's just check the code by printing the every node value system.out.println current.next or actually current.data and the variable uses current.val so data will be val and let's print in one line only so that we are able to at least ensure that all the nodes are getting printed or we are able to run a loop on each and every node then the condition for true is very simple just we can compare with the data so 1 2 3 4 5 that is all the nodes of the link list are printed then obviously we are returning false and it is also getting printed so we are able to travel completely easily but we have to check whether current.value is equal to the target x then the target is found and if target is found return true so let's just check now now the complete linear search is working hopefully it should give me correct output for sample test cases where the target is present but let's just copy the same test case with the target as a 6 is a 6 present in this link list actually no so it should give me false so let's see if it is giving me false or not so we have covered the corner case also where the target is not present unsuccessful search let's also do it for one single node minimum there will be one node in the link list this code will actually work even if there is zero nodes because initially head will itself be null this loop will not run at all because head will be current current will be null so we will stop and we will return false in empty link list you can't you can't find anything so return false so it will work for n0 but let's try it for the constraints minimum n value that is n1 with having let's say only one node 10 and let's say the target is also 10 is a 10 present in a link list containing only one node with data is equals to 10 it should give me true actually let's see yes true but what if the target is 20 x is 20 now it should give me false so let's feed for the corner cases with only one node in the link list it is working now let's submit and it is working for all the test cases as you can see clearly in linear time complexity as linear search takes linear time complexity only and constant space no extra space is required no extra auxiliary data structure we have created within the function so order of n time order of 1 space of the linear search in link list that was a problem link list search I hope now everyone is clear with all the five milestones we will come with a new video and in new video we will obviously discuss a new problem till then bye bye"

        "transcription": "The motivation behind joining Cryo is I wanted to increase my skills as a developer So I wanted to become a software engineer The reason I chose Cryo over the other options was See the other kind of platforms right They give us videos and just we go through them So it's kind of watch and learn And then do it on your own But here there is no watch and learn So it's only do and then learn Unless or otherwise we finish the weekly milestones or the modules right We can't get to learn anything So this removes the part of the fake knowledge right So if we see something and just understand it We may think that okay we know it So why do we need to do it practically But in a lot of cases that actually backfires a lot So yeah that's why I chose Cryo based on these things So I didn't know Java when I started Cryo In Kiewit's I was forced to use Java So I went through a lot of googling to even and initialize an array, start working with it. So since I came from a Pythonic background, Java was not my cup of tea. But yeah, it pushed my limits. Now I'm comfortable in working with Java, so yeah. A community, it was just awesome. Like, each and every one was totally helpful, and they were all friendly, and I also got to make a few friends only through Cryo, and I'm still in contact with them. Cryo can help in a lot of ways. So they can give you a good curriculum, and you can get a good set of projects to start with. So I was wondering about what to do and how to do. So those were the two things Cryo covered for me. Cryo's motto is, start small and go big. Even if you see a big problem, try to break it down into smaller problems, subset of problems. So when you see a small problem, you don't get some anxiety about it. So it's a level of problem that you can achieve easily. So that's something I learned from Cryo, and I'm still using it. Cryo gave me the practical knowledge, and sometimes it also gave me the theory. theoretical knowledge as well. But in most cases, practical knowledge was given to me. And the theoretical knowledge I could search and get to understand what is what. So that's how the reference materials that Cryo gives us works. Cryo taught me the data structures and algorithms in a whole different manner. Cryo's projects definitely helped me a lot in building up my resume. So when I started Cryo, right, I didn't have a lot of projects on my resume. I just had one or two basic projects and those were also some kind of mini projects. It was not that big. Cryo's projects helped me a lot in getting a place in the interviews. So that's one thing. And other than that, the methodology that I learned and the concepts I learned through Cryo, they helped me to crack the interview pretty easily, yeah. If I did not attend Cryo, right, if I didn't use the methodology, learn by doing, so if I was like mindlessly copying and pasting code somewhere and got a good score in lead code or something. else that wouldn't have helped me like this. So the each struggle that I faced through Cryo, so those were the things that helped me to get a job."

So you have to first create a new static sandbox on the CodeSandbox tool. So let us first of all visit the CodeSandbox. So this is the kind of dashboard you should be able to see after logging into your CodeSandbox. Now over here, if you click on new sandbox, after coming on to the dashboard, if you click on new sandbox, you will have to select the static template over here. So let's click on that. After which you will be redirected to this kind of a screen. We'll have to wait for it to completely load. And you already have an HTML template available over here, which we don't want. We are going to create our very own new folder to write our HTML file from scratch. We are going to create a new folder named HTML under which will create a new file called as activity.html. So after that we are going to add an HTML head and body tag and we are also going to close them appropriately. We're also going to write some text inside the body tag, something like first HTML page and we are going to save the file to see the results as well. Also just some cherry points for also giving a title to your web page as cute web page. So let's get started with this demo. I would recommend all of you to pause the video now and try to solve this activity on your own first of all. All right, let us now see how we are going to do the same on code sandbox. So let us go to code sandbox and first of all, let's create a new folder by clicking on this particular icon. I'm going to name it as HTML under which I can create a new file with the help of this icon. I'll say activity.html. Now I will start writing my html code right in this empty file. So I'll first of all say doc type html. It simply tells that I'm going to follow the html5 standards on my html web page. Now I'm going to write html tag first of all, I'm also going to close it. Now between these tags is where the complete encapsulation of my page content will appear. Now over here I want to have my head tag, I'll also try to close it right here and then between the head tag I want to keep the title for which we were getting the cherry points right. So we want to keep our title as cute web page. After the head tag we want the body tag. Now under the body tag we wanted to keep some kind of a sample content. Let's keep it under an h1 tag which stands for a heading. So I can say. This is my first first HTML page and I can close the H1 tag. And now if I save it, I want to run this particular activity dot HTML. Let's see how exactly we can do that. So on to the same URL, you can just add a folder HTML slash activity dot HTML. If you click on enter, you will be able to see the base that you have just created. So this is how you can create your own HTML pages."

I thought that I should check my confidence. In cryo, the mode of education was different. Cryo curriculum, like the course content and all. It was like one of the best. At cryo, I get organized things. So I started following steps they wanted me to follow. It will do my confidence. Learn by doing was the tagline. There is documentation, reading material was there that helped me like reading and implementing. If you are stuck somewhere, you can ask question and clear that doubt and then complete those part of the code. The mentor was great. And he told me that you should fight with that doubt for like two, three days, then come to question. I implemented, I kept implementing. pattern, I learned the pattern. From there, I got good career support. When I told them that I have completed all the required steps, they started giving me the referral to various companies. In my current organization, when I submitted my first project, people who got assigned to analyze my project, they told them that it was great. It has everything a structured code should have. And because I did it by myself, I was able to answer questions of interviewer. Even if you are a little slow, it is okay.

By joining Cryo, I wanted to be ready for all of those things that are new to the market. People expect you to be ready with an answer within a few sentences. That was something only if you work on that you would know how to respond to. Cryo helped me with that. It was a great way to sort of be ready for the interview and also have projects in your bucket. That becomes very important during the interview because the interviewer looks for something unique in you to make you stand out from the other candidates. It gives you that opportunity to do practical projects. These projects, for an experienced professional, definitely help you get noticed by hiring managers because that shows that you have worked on your portfolio aside from the work that you've done in your company. These projects are also pretty unique and that was something one of my recruiters were really impressed about. That's what I was looking for when I joined Cryo, a way to sort of understand and also work with concepts. The micro-experiences were all like bite-sized. help you sort of plan during the day as well. Within 10 minutes or half an hour you easily can finish a micro experience. Making it into chunks made it easier to sort of achieve and also feel good about the progress that you're making every single day. Whenever you get stuck you can just sort of go to the help center, post your doubt, you can give as much detail as you want. Mentors respond within eight hours. That's the maximum I've waited for. They never gave you the answer. It was always about guiding you to the answer which is very great because every time you're stuck you learn so much before you come to the answer. Creo's motto is learn by doing and I think they completely did justice through that in the course. Everyone's way of thinking is different and they sort of encourage you to work on that. So Creo's basically accelerated learning. They give you exactly what you require to achieve your goal of say transitioning a job, getting a job, etc. Salary negotiation and referrals are also provided by Creo which is a great thing that I find in the sense that they are very vocal about it. They keep you in the loop. loop, they send you emails, they add you to groups. The prerequisite for CRIO is that you just have to be a passionate developer, not necessarily a good one, but definitely a passionate one and willing to learn and put in the hours and the effort to make yourself into an employable or an interview ready person. You need to know the structure in which you're supposed to work. And that's something CRIO provided. And that's something I absolutely loved and still do use and still refer back to as well."

        "transcription": "In this video, let us now try to understand what our HTML list and to understand the same, let us now go through one use case. Now look at the following screen snippet. Now you have to check how exactly we can create this. We'll take a look. We have a heading available over here, after which we have a numbered kind of a list. How can we prepare these kind of lists in our webpage? Well, we can do that with the concept of HTML list. Now often we need to provide a list on a page. Let's say you want to show some content or you want to provide some links on your webpage. So for that, you may have two types of list possible on your webpage. Either you can have an unordered or a bulleted list, which can be created by the UL tag. UL stands for unordered list, or you can have an ordered or the numbered list, which is created by the OL tag. OL stands for ordered list. So each item under the list must be enclosed in its own LI tag to denote it as a list item. So under the UL tag or under the OL tag, we will have to create LI tags to list down our items. Now, let us see that with the help of this kind of an example. So if you want to prepare an unordered list, in that case, you'll have to enclose everything under UL tags and each of your item is going to be enclosed under LI tags. Now if you see the above part of the code that results in a bulleted list of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, after which we have another example of an ordered list this time, which is going to show the step one, step two and step three as a numbered steps. So this is the difference between a UL tag and the OL tag. Let us now try to implement this on code sandbox as well. So let us visit code. sandbox. First of all, we'll have our basic HTML template prepared. And on that we are now going to write our unordered and ordered list. So if I write down it in the body tag, the very first thing that I want to make is an unordered list. So I will be writing a UL tag for the same under which I want to create my LI tags. So this is going to be my LI tag. Now I want to write HTML, then I want to write a CSS and JavaScript. So I can copy and paste the same thing and I can just change my list items. Now let us first of all see how is our unordered list looking like. And as you can see, it is a bulleted kind of a list. There is no numbering for the same. But if I change the same thing, this time in an ordered list, so instead of UL, I would like to see an OL. Let us see what is going to be the difference this time. Now this time you have a numbered basis list. So this is what we called an unordered list where no numbering is there and this is what we called an ordered list where the numbering is also present. So this is how overall the lists are expected to work in HTML. In this video, you have to perform an activity on adding the list. So you will have to prepare this kind of a web page which will have the heading some cool features of Cupcake Ipsum. Now you are going to create a bulleted list for the same which is going to have the points as it's fun to use, easy to create and makes you look cool after which you want to add another heading which says how to generate it and for that you will be creating a numbered list which will say the points as go to the website then selecting the options then copy to clipboard and then paste. So this is the activity you need to solve. So pause the video now and try to solve this on your own first of all. Alright, so let us now see how we are going to solve this activity. So let us first of all visit code sandbox to do this. So going on code sandbox, we'll have a template already available within which we will be implementing this. So the first thing that we want to do over here is have a heading. So for the heading, I'm going to make use of an h3 tag so that I can make my heading look in the appropriate font sizes. You can also wish to have another heading tags as per your wish. Now what is the heading we are trying to give for the same? Some cool features of cupcake ipsum. So let's try to give it the same thing. Some let's do that some cool features of cupcake ipsum. Now under this we want to create an unordered list. So I will be giving it a ul tag under which I want to list down some items. Now what are going to be these items? Let's see we have a total of I guess three items. items. First is it's fun to use, easy to create and makes you look cool. So let's add the same three things. It's fun to use, easy to create and makes you look cool. Right. Now just after this there will be another h3 heading. Again as per your wish you can give anything else as well. How to generate it? Now let's make an ordered list for this one. So this is how we create an ordered list under which I again want to have my li tags for the listing down the items. So I'll create four such and what are the steps we need to write? Go to the website, select the options, copy to clipboard and paste. So let's write the same thing over here. go to the website, select the options, copy the clipboard and paste. So let us now try to save this file and see the output and this is exactly how it looks. Some cool features of Cupcake Ipsum. We have a bulleted list with the help of unordered list tag which is given by ul and just after that we have a numbered list for the generation part which is a ol tag. So this is how you solve this activity."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video, we will be discussing the problem count the number of 1 bits in an integer 1 bits or you can say set bits in an integer so count set bits is the problem. The problem is we have to write a function what it will do is it will take a unsigned integer as input it means it will take a positive integer as input of 32 bits because in the question it is given 32 buttons unsigned integer will be given so 32 bits number which is always positive is given as an input what we need to do in this in that number is we need to find or return the number of 1 bits set bits 1 bits or you can say the bits which are equal to 1 which should be the output and the number of 1 bits is also known as hamming weight basically count set bits is nothing but counting the or calculating the hamming weight of a given number. So let's basically take a number which I am saying, although it will have 32 bits, but for simplicity, let's just have a number 1 0 1 0 0 double 1 0. So I am only taking how many bits I am just taking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 bits. If we are able to deduce a logic in 8-bit number, we will also be able to deduce the logic in 32-bit number. It is just extending it to 32 bits. So always whenever we work on bits, what is the bit index starting from always the bit index starts from the rightmost bit that is 0 1 2 3rd bit 4th bit 5th index bit 6th index bit and 7th index bit because there are total 8 bits in this number. Obviously, we can assume rest are all zeros. How many set bits are there? How many bits are 1 in this as you can see very clearly there are 4 set bits. So output should be 4 answer should be 4 even if you take other test cases the if input number is 5 5 binary representation is 1 then you can say 0 1 that is 4 plus 1 5 and then remaining all zeros. So how many set bits are there? Only two set bits are there. Output is 2. So given the number in an integral form, given the number in a 32 bit integer, you don't have to actually find out the binary representation. You have to work on bits. So for that prerequisite will be bit manipulation. You should know how to use left shift operator, right shift operator and operator or operator these kind of bit manipulation operators operators you should know then only you will be able to solve it. Otherwise it will be very difficult to first generate the binary representation and then count the number of ones. So given a number how we can count the set bits that is actually the question but approach one very simple. If you know how to check whether a bit is a set or not, what you can do is you can run a loop over all the bits and check whether they are set or not. Check set bit for each bit. in the range for each bit in what in the range 0 to 32 minus 1 0 to 31 and whenever you get the check set bit as true you will say count plus plus that is somehow you will implement a function which will check whether the zeroth bit is set or not you will say false so don't do count plus plus initially count will you can say will be zero then next is the first index bit set yes count plus plus or answer plus plus second bit set yes count plus plus third bit set no fourth bit set no fifth bit set yes count plus plus sixth bit set no finally seventh bit set yes so answer will be four now the point is since we are going to run a loop on every bit irrespective of whether the bit is set or not it will take time complexity as equal to the total number of bits so given a number n total number of bits of a number n will be log base 2 n however since the number is only containing 32 bits you can say it is equivalent to order of 32 right now which is equivalent constant. So either you say logarithmic or use a constant. Both are correct time complexity depending on the constraints of this question. What about the space complexity? This solution which will check whether a bit is a set or not will be just constant space. No need to use extra space. You will just create a mask to check whether a bit is set. We will also discuss how to create that but space will be constant. No extra space as such. Now the point is how to check whether a bit is a set or not. So given this number itself let's copy this number two times. One time I will take a bit which is set and one time I will take an example which is not set. First let's do a dry run for the third index bit. Actually first let's do a dry run for the bit which is second index zero. This is zero index first index second index. So I am doing a dry run for second index to check whether the second index bit is set or not. To check whether a bit is set or not what you need to do first of all is create a mask and how should the mask look like. The mask should look like all. the bits except the second index which we need to check should be zero and the second index bit should be one in that mask that is all zeros before the second index all zeros after the second index. So this is the mask which we have to perform which we have to create and how we have to create this mask how we can do it is we can basically make a number which is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 and shift this one towards the left by how many places by two places by bit number of places so this mask will be nothing but one left shift by bit number of times whatever bit we are getting if it is two one left shift two times that is make it go to the second index once the bit is left shifted by once the one bit is left shifted by bit number of places and we are able to form the mask what to do with this mask we have to do the mask and with the number itself that is if I will do n and mask what I will get is one and zero 0, 0, 0 and 0, 0, 1 and 0, 0, 0 and 0, 0, 0, here also 1 and 0 will be 0, 0 and 0 will be 0. What about this? The operation AND does what? Any bit AND 1 will always give you that same bit. If it will be 0, it will give you 0, if it will be 1, it will give you 1. But when it comes to bit AND 0, it will always give you 0, that's why all these bits are coming out to be 0. Because anything with 0, if you do AND, it will always come out to be 0. But when it comes to bit with AND with 1 bit, then whatever is here, it will come in the answer also, in the AND mask also. So since AND mask is nothing but a number which is not equal to 0, it is having a bit set. If a number is 0, all the bits will be unset, all the bits will be 0. Since this number is not equal to 0, we will say there is the second bit set, so we will return true, it is set, we have to check whether a bit is set or not. However, if I take the same number, but I want to check, let's Let's say for third index, whether the third index bit is a set or not, it should give me false. How will it give me false? First of all, create the mask as it has done in the previous code. However, this time mask will be one left shift, left shift B, one left shift, left shift three. That is make the third index bit set all other bits unset in the mask. And now do the mask and N that is you will have this value, this blue value as N you will do N and mask, you will get the answer. All other bits will be zero, of course, apart from the bit which we are concerned off. But when it comes to the third bit, also zero and one will also be giving you zero to all the bits are zero. So this number entirely number and mask is giving you zero. So if it is giving you zero, you should return false. So this is how you will check whether a bit is set or not. And this is how you have to check for each bit one by one, check for this first index, second index, third index, and so on. And whichever bits are giving you true check set bits function, you will do count plus plus. This is a very good approach. No problem in this approach. The most optimized time, the most optimized space. You can't do better than it in the worst case, but the point is. You will have to write a little bit more code in this approach. There is an alternative approach, which is algorithm designed by some scientist or mathematician. The algorithms name is coming comes algorithm. I might pronounce the name incorrectly, but let's actually go to the approach number two, which will be shorter in the length in the, you can say the total syntax for the code will be shorter in all the programming languages. Obviously if you are not able to remember that approach, if you are not able to learn that Cunningham's algorithm, what are you going to do is you can go ahead with this approach. No one will stop you and no one will say that you are writing a less optimized code. Actually it is not less optimized. It is the best. You can't do better than constant, obviously less than constant is nothing. So let's take. the same number and what we need to do is in the Cunningham's algorithm the approach number two alternative approach which will be a shorter code is we will somehow directly jumps from set bit to the next set bit from set bit to the next set bit that is if a number let's say contains four set bits what this Cunningham's algorithm will do is run the loop for only four times not 32 times if a 32 bit integer only contain four set bits run the loop only on those four set bits somehow if the number contains 32 set bits then of course the loop will run for 32 times that's why the worst case will remain same but maybe if the number does not contain any set bits in that case the loop will not run at all so it is dependent on the number of set bits the algorithm name is I am writing it also Cunningham's Cunningham's algorithm Cunningham's algorithm it will run the loop on directly set bits how will it run. It will start from the right most set bit. This is RSB. I am writing right most set bit and it will go to the left most set bit one by one. How will it do it? How will it basically go ahead is it will try to convert the Cunningham's algorithm will try to convert this number by removing the right most set bit. Let me write again. This is the right most set bit. This is the left most set bit again and again. What this algorithm will do is it will remove the right most set bit and make it unset. That is the new number after unsetting the first right most set bit will be 10100100. This is step number one or you can say count plus plus count is one. Now first step performed first right most set bit removed. Are there more steps? You can say set bits. Yes, there are three set bits. How to know whether there are set bits or not? If the number is zero, there are zero set bits. If the number is nonzero, there are at least one set bit. Since this number was not equal to zero, there is at least one set bit. This number is also not equal to zero. There is at least one set bit. So somehow the algorithm will remove that set bit and the new number after removing the rightmost set bit will be what one zero one zero zero zero zero zero in just one single operation we will be able to remove the rightmost set bit that we will discuss using the formula but this number although the counter becomes to the second operation we are able to perform still this number is not equal to zero still we are having some set bits left so still count will continue that is we will still go to the next rightmost set bit and remove it so what is that rightmost set bit now it is this particular bit I will remove it new number will become one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero so count will become three because this is the third operation which we are able to perform although this number is also not equal to zero so we will once more remove the rightmost set bit in this number which is this particular bit and as soon as I remove it. will happen the number will become all zeros bits and the count will become four and since number have all zero set bits all zero bits not sets and set you can say so this number is equal to zero so stop now that is we have counted all the set bits which is four but the point is how to remove the rightmost set bit from a given number let's say the number is n how to remove the rightmost set bit from a number you can use a very simple formula that is n and with n minus one just do the and of n and the previous number and what it will do is it will remove the rightmost set bit from that that is convert 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 to 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 remove the last one and make it zero make it unset similarly here if this number is n next number will be n and n minus one now let's see how let's copy this number actually let's just again copy this number Maybe let's copy it from the previous slide and let's see that how the n and n minus one is going to remove the rightmost at bit. This will clear the rightmost at bit clear RSB. So let me write the n minus one value. This is n value. What is n minus one? You will say it will be one zero one zero zero one zero one. This will be the previous number because this is nothing but two two minus one will be give you one and this is one and other digits or other bits will remain same. And if you will do the and between these two numbers, what will the new number become? These bits which are same will remain same, no change to them, but this one and with zero will give you zero. This is zero and with one will give you zero. And this is what we are having after removing the rightmost at bit. As you can compare this bit, which was the RSB in n is removed in the output in n and n minus one. It is not there. You can apply the same step one more time. Maybe if I can show you for one more time it is not that much intuitive that why it is going to work but this is a step which you can maybe cram it is just anyways to numbers getting and with each other although there is explanation which you can try to find out that is whenever you do and with n minus 1 what will happen is all the digits after the rightmost set bit towards the left will remain as it is and whatever digits are before the rightmost set bits in n minus 1 they will be nothing but you can say they will be nothing but ones and if you will do and between them since they will be opposite of these numbers not once we are you can say opposite of the first number n and n minus 1 will have opposite bits in these two places and here so if you will do the and between them always different bits will give you and 0 0 and 1 will give you 0 1 and 0 will give you 0 and these bits will remain same and what will happen to the RSB If n is having rsb as 1, n-1 will have rsb as 0, this is very important because you are subtracting the number and if rsb we are subtracting the 1 from rsb will become 0 always like it will never happen that the highest bit is becoming 0, lowest set bit will become 0 first that is how you will subtract. So let me just give one more demonstration from this number if I will do the n and n-1 1 0 let me write in different color 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 so this is something then 4 in decimal it will be 4 so what will 4-1 will give you 4-1 will give you 3 what is 3 0 1 1 this is 3 and remaining will remain same that is what the lowest bit the right most set bit will become 0 when you will do n-1 so this is n this is n-1 and if you will do and between them the new number will be zero and one different bits become zero different bits become zero different bits become zero and all these remaining bits will remain same because they are same in both n and n minus one so you are again able to remove the right most set but this bit is gone now it is unset now so the optimized algorithm will be not optimized but alternative approach will be do update n make n become n and n minus one again and again again and again again and again and do the count plus plus till the n reaches zero till it not become zero run the loop as soon as it becomes zero stop so we will actually write the instruction manual using this cunningham's algorithm directly so what we have to do is we can say let's maintain a count set count integer as zero because we have to return integer at that at max there can be 32 set bits only run the loop preferably a while loop till the point this n variable does not reach zero if it is not equal to zero till that run the loop because if all bits are zero then there is no more bits to be counted which are set but how to remove how to clear the right most set bit right most set bit it is the procedure is update n as the value n and n minus one update the n the same variable by this value and also do the count plus plus increment count by one that is the number of times this loop will run the number of iterations in carningham's algorithm will be equivalent to the number of the set bits or the hamming weight and now you can return the hamming weight you can return the count so this approach as i already discussed in worst case it will remain same it will remain logarithmic only because in worst case all bits can be set in the number if a number is 32 bits and all 32 bits are set it will go to each and every bit and remove it one by one So worst case will still be logarithmic, however, in average case, you can say it will reduce the time complexity a little bit because we are just going to set bits, not all the bits. But worst case will remain same. And if n is given to you as 2 risks per 32, or you can say if the number of bits log n is given, given to you as 32 only, so it is order of 32, which is still constant. So both approaches, previous approach was also constant time, constant space, although it was going to all the bits, this particular approach, and the current approach also is going to all the bits in worst case, so same time, same space, constant time, constant space, however, smaller code, a lot of, you can say, length of the code or function altogether, the check set bit you have removed now. So given this instruction manual, we will be using it in Milestone 4 to write the code in Java language. So first we have to count the number of set bits, so we will create a count variable set to 0. We will do count++. till the time the loop runs and the number does not become zero as soon as the number becomes zero we have to stop this loop will only go to set bits how we will one by one clear the set bit clear the rightmost bit set bit specifically by updating n as the n and with n minus one do the n and of n with the previous number with one smaller number and whatever number of times this loop will run that is the number of set bits so count plus plus each time in the loop and return the count as simple as that so if i would have removed all these commands all these steps which i have written in the instruction manual this will be just four lines of code nothing much so if i will run this hopefully it should get accepted for sample test case for the number five which is represented in binary as 101 it should give me two set bits only two bits are there which are set so let's see as you can see for three also there are two bits although the input was five but when it is running it is checking for three let's take a very big number maybe let's take a number which is 158 any random number I have taken I am not sure how many set bits will be there although in the constraints they have mentioned the maximum number can be 2 raised power 32 minus 1 that's why they have taken long data type so in this number there are 5 set bits it is working correctly let's submit now and actually see whether the logic is working for every kind of test case or not it is taking some time and as you can see all the 23 test cases are passing the time complexity of this code will be logarithmic log base 2n where n is the unsigned integer however since the number of bits log n is the nothing but the number of bits given in the quotient is only 32 either you can say log base 2n is the time or you can also say order of 32 is the time and since order of 32 is all order of 1 so it is also constant time because log n is very very less when n is very very less So log n or constant time complexity and the space since you can see there is no extra data structure, no extra auxiliary thing which you have created, no recursion, nothing like that. So constant space. So constant time, constant space solution for this problem. With that we are done with this."

Apart from Spring, Spring Boot, which I wanted, it included like TSA, HOOPS concept, then there was low level design, getting to know like multiple approaches in this TSA course. So that is what I learned. Like to solve a problem, there can be many approaches. And after that, I landed to the Spring Boot one and Spring Boot dependency, dependency injection, IOC. container. These projects are like very close to the actual apps which you might have seen. For example, if you have used ET money similar to that, there will be a project called Q money. If you have used Spotify, there will be something called a jukebox. So Cryo also provided like a cloud platform where you can basically develop or code it from anywhere.

        "transcription": "So let's solve the problem find if there exists a subarray with zero sum or not in this particular video what we are given is a array of integers which are either positive or negative numbers we need to find if there is any subarray with zero sum existing or not check whether is any subarray whose sum of all the elements are zero if yes then most probably we have to say true or yes something we have to print yes otherwise we have to print no if there is no such subarray a subarray is a set of contiguous elements if you don't know subarray the part of a array or you can say a section of array where all the elements are consecutive contiguous one after the other if I am starting the subarray from left going till right all the integers from left to right should be included in the subarray having at least size one it should be true. should not be empty subarray because if you will consider empty subarray, it will of course be of zero sum. So always the answer will come out to be true. So we have to take the subarray with at least one length and if there is, we have to print true. So as you can see, if there are two test cases, the first test case is having four sized array containing elements 4, 2, minus 2, 5. So is there any subarray with zero sum answer is yes. The elements 2, minus 2, they will form a subarray with some zero that's it. That's why the answer is yes. But if I take the array of three size and the array is 3, 2, minus 1, there is no subarray who the sum is zero, only 3, 3, 2 is 5, 3, 2, minus 1 is nothing but 4, 2, minus 1 is some 1, minus 1 is already minus 1. So there is no subarray with zero sum hence the answer is no. So find all the subarrays and check whether there is any such a subarray. If yes, answer is true. So what? we can do as a brute force solution is just find all the sub-arrays possible and in order to find all these sub-arrays we can just have a nested loop that is one loop for the starting index and one loop for the ending index where is the sub-array starting and where is the sub-array ending and if we are getting the sub-array given from starting index till the ending index having some zero we will return yes otherwise if no such sub-array found finally we will return no. so if i quickly do a dry run for the first test case 4 2 minus 2 or maybe let's take 4 5 2 minus 2 and then let's take 1 so in this case what we will do we will take the starting index as 4 we will take the initially sum as 0 although we will not have to compare initially is the sum equal to 0 or not otherwise we will just check for the empty sub-array we will take the ending index we will say add the variable from ending index it is 0 plus 4 is this equal to zero is the sub-array of zero sum no. Add the value of 5 in the sum is the sum 0 no. Add the value 2 in the sub-array is the sum 0 no. Add the value of n in the sub-array is the sum 0 no, this sum is not 0. Add the value of n in the sub-array is this sum 0 no. So starting from the 0th index there is no sub-array of zero sum. Now let's try for the sub-array starting from the first index having value 5. So if I will take only 5 initially it will be 0 plus 5 you can say it is not equal to 0. 5 plus 2 is 7 not equal to 0. 7 minus 2 is nothing but again 5 not equal to 0 and 5 plus 1 is 6 not equal to 0. But as soon as I take the sub-array starting from second index having value 2, 0 plus 2 is although not equal to 0 but 2 minus 2 will be equal to 0 and if found we will return true. So in this approach since we are having a starting loop and ending loop, 2 nested loops or 2 loops which are nested the overall time complexity will be order of n square where n is the array size. And if we talk about the space complexity, since we just require two pointers start and end, no extra space as such will be required. So constant space solution will be there, but this is nothing but the brute force of solution. A basic solution. Can we optimize it further? The answer is yes, but in order to optimize the time complexity, we have to do a trade-off. We have to take extra space in order to make the time complexity go from n square to maybe n. We have to use some extra space. We can't rearrange the elements. So that is the point that we can't just have the sorted array or something. We have to do the processing in the same array, but there is a very beautiful observation when it comes to a subarray of zero sum. So if I take a subarray, a longer subarray to figure out that observation, let's just take a subarray having elements 2, 3, 7, then let's say 10. let's take minus 3 let's take minus 4 and initially also let's have a value which is minus maybe minus 15 or maybe minus 20 something like this then let's take let's have a value which is maybe minus 3 so and let's have a value which is 5 if this is the array given to us we need to find such a subarray whose sum is 0 so is there any subarray whose sum is 0 answer is yes while i was creating the array i was thinking of such a array and the subarray you can actually form is nothing but this particular subarray which is having the elements 10 minus 3 minus 4 and minus 3 so 10 minus 3 will be 7 7 minus 4 will be 3 3 minus 3 will be 0 so this subarray have 0 sum but how to find a subarray of 0 sum see if i just ask you what is the sum of all the elements before 10 sum of all the elements before 10 will be minus 20 plus 2 plus 3 plus 7 which is how much which is you can say let's not take minus 20 for now let's just take minus 5 for now or maybe not minus 5 but minus 6 for now a smaller negative value so if it is minus 6 minus 6 plus 2 will be minus 4 minus 4 plus 3 will be minus 1 minus 1 plus 7 will be 6 so this sum is a 6 this particular sum from zeroth index till third index is 6 and as we know this sub array is of zero sum but what is the sum of this entire long array starting from zeroth index till the seventh index the sum will come out to be 6 the original sum minus 6 plus 2 plus 3 plus 7 plus this particular sum which is 0 so 6 plus 0 it will still remain 0 only so what is the observation the observation is whenever there is a sub array 0 sum the sum till the ending index will be equal to the sum till the starting index minus 1. If I repeat it again, what is the sum till starting index minus 1? That is what is the sum till third index? Sum is 6. What is the sum till the ending index? That is what is the sum till 7th index? The sum is 6 only. So if the sum if I say till the starting index, let's say the starting index is ST minus 1 is equal to the sum till the ending index, then that particular subarray from starting till ending is a subarray of 0 sum. Although we don't need to find what is the starting and ending index, we just need to return true or false or yes or no. But since we need the sum, we have to store it somewhere and we have to check whether a sum has already occurred or not. And if a sum has already occurred, then we can say there is a 0 sum subarray because from the last occurrence of 6 till the next occurrence of 6. there is a sub-array of zero sum so if plus 10 minus 3 minus 4 minus 3 these are prefixes only so we have to check whether there is any prefix sum which is repeating if it is repeating then of course there is a zero sum sub-array so let's just start this logic the observation hopefully is clear let's just undo all of these things and for now let's just take this value as minus 6 let's also do what let's also remove this box and let's do a try run initially what we are going to say is till now there is no sum found initially we are not able to find any sum so what data structure we are going to maintain that is it right now not clear to us that what data structure should we have but let's just have an imaginary box with us. Initially, there is no sum found. We will have the initial sum to 0. 0 minus 6, minus 6 sum is found. Is minus 6 already occurring? Is there any other sub-array, any other prefix sum whose sum is minus 6? No. So, till now there is no sub-array of 0 sum which is non-empty. Next element will be 2. So, minus 6 plus 2 will be plus 4. Is there any sub-array whose sum is 4 or not sub-array but actually prefix array whose sum is 4? No. Minus 4 sum is not there in this data structure but I will surely push it now so that it gets repeated again. Then we will say yes, there is a sub-array of 0 sum. So, we have to push it in the data structure. Then the element is 3. Minus 4 plus 3 will be how much? Minus 4 plus 3 will be minus 1. Is there any prefix array whose sum is minus 1 already occurring? No. For the first time, minus 1 is there. So, we will push it in the data structure. Then there will be 7. Minus 1 plus 7 will be plus 6. Is there any prefix adding whose sum is plus 6? No. But we will push it now so that next time it occurs, we already know it is there. Then element is 10, so plus 6 plus 10 will be 16. There is no sub-array of 16 sum or no prefix of 16 sum, so we will push it in the data structure. Next element will be minus 3, that is 16 minus 3 will be 13 sum, again not occurring. 13 minus 4 will be how much? It will be 9. 9 is also not there, but as soon as I will do 9 minus 3 which is 6, 6 is already there. This sum 6 will be already there. Let me just write it here also. This sum will come out to be 6 and 6 is already there in the data structure. So what should be the first of all data structure which we are going to maintain? Since we need to store integers and we need to find whether they are present in the data structure or not in the most optimized manner. What is the data structure which helps in checking? whether element is already visited or not that data sector is nothing but a hash map or a hash set currently since there are only keys only one single value not pairs not key value pairs we can do the work with hash set also that is just keys only no key value pairs no maps required but even if you want to do it with maps you can still do it it will be no harm but what we can say we will store all the prefix array the sums in this hash set data sector or in this visited data sector which is going to give me whether a key is already present or not in constant amount of time in average case hash set will be able to find element in constant time in average case and also it will be able to insert the keys in constant time in average case so overall hash set will be the best data sector and since we are going to run a single loop only on the input array the time complexity will be constant into n. So overall time complexity will come out to be linear and overall space complexity for this particular solution. Since we are using a extra data sector known as hash set, which is going to store all the keys, all the prefix arrays, all these values, how much will be the maximum size of this? We can say the array size itself that is order of n. But there is a very important corner gate. Actually two corner cases are there. This is a sample input where there was actually no corner case, but let's take the second test case where if I give you an array having elements 2, 3, then let's take minus 4, then let's take minus 5 and let's have a value 0 in this array itself. Then let's take plus 10. So if I take this array particularly, what will be the subarray whose sum is 0? We can say there is an element 0 itself. So this will form a subarray also whose sum is 0. So answer should be true. Let's see if our logic is working. file or not initially we will say the hash set is empty for now we are just saying hash set is empty that is the data structure which we are maintaining for all the prefixes are empty and sum is also 0 0 plus 2 2 is not present till now 2 plus 3 3 is also not present till now actually 2 plus 3 is 5 5 is also not present and 5 minus 4 is 1 1 is also not present 1 minus 5 is minus 4 minus 4 is also not present then minus 4 plus 0 is again minus 4 this is sum currently will be this is minus 4 minus 4 plus 0 will again be minus 4 and you can say minus 4 is already there in the data structure and since it is already there it is repeating that is the subarray sum till this point is equal to subarray sum till this point it means this current element itself is of 0 value or you can directly check also whether the current array value is 0 but still the logic will be working fine so for this answer is true but there is one more test case which will go actually wrong. If we are starting with the empty hash set, what if prefix itself is of zero sum? Let me take us array having two, three, then let's take four. Let's take then maybe having a value that is minus nine and let's take five. If this is the array, is there any subarray whose sum is zero? And I will say yes, this particular subarray having some five plus four, nine, nine minus nine is zero. And if I will apply the same logic initially starting with an empty hash set, let's see if it is going to work fine or not. Initially a hash set will be empty. Zero plus two, zero plus two will be two. Push it in the data sector because two is not visited yet. Two plus three is five. Five is also not visited. Five plus four is nine. Nine is also not visited. Nine minus nine is zero. Zero is not there in this data sector. So we will say, push it in for the first time. Then zero plus five is. nothing but five five is also not there so you will never be able to say that a key is repeating so what we need to do we need to also push zero initially in the hash set or you can say whenever there is a prefix of zero sum then we can just simply return true or simply return yes whenever a prefix itself is of zero sum return true or just start already with a zero in the hash set that is before running the loop just have one key already in the hash set which is of zero sum so that when it gets repeated we can say there is a sub array which is prefix itself whose sum is zero starting from the the minus one index plus one that is zeroth index itself and the entire array till the last index so let's do what let's now write the instruction manual first of all what we need we need to create a hash set of integers because we need to store this sum and some most probably will fit into integers if it will not fit in the particular programming language, whichever code you will be writing in just take bigger integers or you can say 64 bit integers, long numbers, types of data type. So we have to create a hazard of integers. Let's say the hazard name is prefix because it will just store the prefix some initially what we will say create a some variable which will be initially as zero create a sum and set as zero set it as zero sum but also push this sum into the data structure push or maybe add this sum in the hash set because we have to initially have a empty subarray sum also in the hash set although we don't need to say return yes but if it will be repeated we will say there is a prefix itself of zero sum now we can run a for loop over all elements over all integers of array if you want you can just directly run a for each loop that is one by one get each value of the array. directly if you will get the value you don't need the indices you will say whatever value you are getting just add in the sum add val in the sum and now check whether this sum is already there in the visited hash set or not if the sum is present in the hash set it means there is a subarray of zero sum and if it is if yes you can say answer is true return yes but if it is not there then push it so that next time it occurs we can say it is there already so else if it is not there just push it so add the sum in the hash set in the prefix hash set and finally if there is no subarray found of zero sum finally we can say that return no no subarray found of zero sum so this entire logic what will be the time complexity since we are going to run a for loop on all the integers insertion and finding will take constant time so overall time complexity will be linear only what about space since we are going to create a hash set which will be extra space space will also be linear so linear time linear space optimization is there we will be writing the code for the problem let's just have a hash set first of all I will be writing the code in Java programming language so I will say hash set of integer angular bracket integer the hash set name is prefix because we are going to show prefixes in it it will be initially empty although we should not let it remain empty whatever the empty subarray sum is just push it in the hash set so that if there is a prefix itself of zero sum we will be able to say that there is a zero sum subarray and then we have to run a for loop over all the elements we can just run a for loop in the terms of for each loop that is directly on the values no need to run the loop on indices whatever values we will get one by one from the array which is a vector in this case we will add in the and this new prefix sum we will check whether it is already there because if the subarray is there whose sum is zero the sum the prefix sum till left minus one till start minus one will be equal to the sum till end index so if this sum already exists if prefix dot contains this sum is it true contains the function to check whether a sum is there in the hash set or not then we have to return yes that we are able to find a zero sum subarray although if not then next time if it occurs we have to push it into the data sector into the visited hash set so we will say prefix dot add will be the function name and we will just add the current sum but if no such subarray sum found then we will return no so let's just try it for the first of all the sample test case that is for 4 2 minus 5 and 3 2 minus 1 it should give me yes and no let's see if it is going to give me yes and no it is not able to find the variable val. So let's just have the variable name val instead of element. You can name it anything. Let's see if it is now going to work for sample test case. And as you can see it is working fine. Although the sample test case is different from this test case, which is getting run as you can see one comma minus one is also going to give me zero sum. But if I take a test case where the sub variable not give you zero sum or maybe let's check three test cases. First test case is three. Three elements and the elements are three two minus one. It should be no as you can see here. Also the second test case. Let's just have three values one zero two. It should give me true because there is an element itself whose sum is zero and let's just also take a test case where the prefix itself is of zero sum. So one minus one two, it should give me true. All the guess also so output should be no. Yes. Yes, let's see. It's taking some time to run and as you can see all the types of corner cases where the prefix itself is 0, there is element 0 and also there is no 0sum subarray. All them are working perfectly fine. Let's submit it to see and as you can see already all the 26 test cases are getting accepted and as we have already discussed in the approach video, what will be the time complexity since we are going to run a loop over the array of n elements where we are just grinding the element in the hash set or adding the element in the hash set. Both of these operations take constant time in average case. So overall time of this loop will be linear and overall code will also be linear in time. And what about space? Due to this extra hash set data structure, the space complexity will also turn out to be linear. So linear time, linear space, order of n time, order of n space solution for this problem checking whether a 0sum subarray exists or not. With that we are done with the problem. We will meet in a new video with a new problem. Till then bye-bye."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone. Welcome back in this particular video. We will be discussing the problem search in a sorted rotated array is an array which is sorted in ascending order. But now the point is it is not only sorted in increasing order. It is rotated about a pivot which is unknown to you. It was used to be sorted array. But after sorted after being the added to be in increasing order, it was rotated in the form of some clockwise rotations or you can say there was a index of pivot index on which the array was rotated. Now such a array is referred as a rotated sorted array or sorted pivoted array. Both are one and the same thing sorted array, but rotated in nature not completely sorted after rotation. Obviously example is if let's say the array used to be 1 2 3 4 5 before. rotation after rotation I picked the smaller value and actually I picked the value 4 and I rotated it up along 4 or actually not around 4 around 3 that is I made the 3 element 4 element 5 element go in the front that is 3 4 5 1 2 is what the array is after the rotation what do you need to do is in such array which is a rotated sorted array you have to get a target value get some integer value and check whether the integer value is present or not return the index in which it is stored in zero based indexing otherwise if it is not found then return minus 1 so let's take the example of 3 4 5 1 2 itself since this array is rotated sorted if I ask you that what is the index of the target maybe 2 so you will say it is at present at the fourth index what is the target where 4 is present you will say first index what is the target uh index of six there is no six present in this array so return minus one so i think the problem is clear you can also see the sample input sample input is containing four five six nine ten and then two three so rotated sorted array two three four five six nine ten so it was used to be sorted but now rotated if the target is two two is present at the sixth index if the target is you can say three then three is present at which index three is actually present at uh there is some problem actually this is the second test case this is the first test case and this is the other test case something like that or maybe it might be something else let's see what is the input format input format is that first there will be q plus three lines of code first line will be the size of array then the next line will contain n integers which is the array elements third line will contain a single integer q denoting the number of targets okay so basically it is the number of test cases so there are two test cases first test cases is 3 3 is present at the 6th index. So 6 is answer. The next test case is 8 8 is present in the array. No, since it is not present print minus 1. So I have taken an arrow already in my notes using this array. We will try to deduce that approaches. First of all, if let's say the target given to you is the value maybe 80 you need to check where is 80 present. I will say it is present at the third index. You have to return 3. However, if the target is let's say maybe 25 in that case, you will say minus 1 because 25 is not present. So in this case answer should be 3 in this case answer should be minus 1 but the point is how will you figure out it? One of the easiest approach which surely most of you will be able to figure out is the linear search algorithm in which you will just simply run a loop over all the elements irrespective of whether array is sorted rotated, whatever we just run a loop over all the elements one by one and check whether it is present or not. Irrespective of the ordering of elements linear search will always work. So to just run a linear search that is a linear traversal over array of n size. It will take linear time. Although the space will be constant that is no extra space required. But is it the most optimized solution? Surely not. Why because we have not used the fact that arrays rotated sorted array. So if we have to use rotated sorted array one optimization over linear search, which usually works on sorted arrays are binary search algorithms, but binary search algorithm in this case cannot work directly. Why it cannot work directly? The point is the array is not completely sorted. It used to be sorted but now it is rotated. So since you know, you can apply a binary search on a sorted array, you know how to apply it. I am assuming it is a prerequisite for this question, but you don't know how to apply it in a rotated sorted array. So how about first figuring out where is the rotated at orbit what is the pivot index once we know the pivot index then we can just apply the binary search around that pivot that is given this array which is having the range from 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 increasing and then there is a dip and then from 10 till 40 it is again increasing so in such a kind of array what we can do is we can just figure out this pivot index where the array was rotated that is these two segments of the array first segment will be from 50 to 110 second segment will be 10 till 40 because array if it would have been sorted how would that it would look like 10 20 30 40 then for 50 60 70 80 up till up till 110 so rotated sorted array so just figure out the two points on which the array is rotated just figure out this pivot this is the pivot where array is rotated you can just figure out the pivot in terms of 6th index or 7th index in this example once you are able to figure out the pivot index what you can do is can apply the binary search in the left part of the pivot and in the right part of the pivot and you know already how to apply binary search it is just a range of the binary search will change instead of binary search simply on 0 till n-1 it will be from 0 till pivot and pivot plus 1 till n-1 but the point is how we can find this pivot index that is the 6th index let's say we are figuring out the 6th index that is the last index of the first segment or you can say the index previous to the first element of the second segment so how can you figure out the 6th any special value which is present at the 6th index and the answer is yes if you will see that these values are 10 20 30 40 this used to be in the left hand side if array was not rotated so all these values are smaller than all of these values the second part if I say this is the second part this is the first part all of the values are second in the second part are smaller than the values in first  and how about if I say that among the first part the values are increasing order it means 110 is more than all these values since first part is in increasing order it means 110 is more than all these values since second part is also in increasing order and second part used to be before first part before rotation all these values are smaller than first part it means the element present at 6th index which is 110 is actually the maximum element it is also pretty obvious to observe that actually 6th index is the maximum element and 7th index is the minimum element this is the max this is the min so you can just easily figure out max or min but that too not using a simple linear search otherwise you are just having same time complexity you have to figure out the maximum value or the minimum value using binary search itself and the point is how will you figure out the maximum or the minimum using binary search so for that Let's pick this array on the next page. Let's copy this array on the next page and let's try to first do the binary search to find the maximum index, not the value, but the index. So I am finding max index, something like this. That is six index in this case. So we have to actually work on the same observation that is all these values in the left segment are smaller than 110. All these values are greater than 110, but there is one more observation which we can make. Let's just mark these two segments again. This is the first segment, which is, I am saying is the rotated segment or actually both are rotated only the entire array is rotated. Let's just say it is the first segment. And this is the second segment, any bifurcation, which you can do any distinguishing factor between the first segment and second segment, which you can figure out so that you can apply binary search because in binary search, normal binary search will work on it. target. The question is to find out a target only, but right now the focus is not to find the target, but to first find the pivot. If we know the pivot, we can easily apply binary search to find the target also. So in order to find pivot, we don't know where the pivot will be. We don't know where the maximum element or the minimum element will be. That is the question itself right now. So observation is if let's say we land on some mid value, we are initially having left pointer at zero. We are initially having right pointer at the array dot length minus one, because we don't know where the minimum element or the maximum element will be. We are just finding maximum. Mid will come out to be zero plus 10 by two, which is the fifth index. Now what to do with this fifth index? You don't know actually where the maximum will be with respect to 100. Why? Because if you will ask to the mid index, the array is in increasing order right now from four to five to six values are ninety hundred and ninety. 10 so it is increasing in nature even if the middle was let's say at the 9th index or let's say at the 8th index still the array would be increasing why because 8th index is having value 20 9th index is having value 30 4th and the 10th index is having value 40 so it is still increasing in nature you can't just simply say that in this particular segment value is decreasing in nature in this particular segment value is increasing in nature no in both the regions values are increasing it is also increasing slope this is also increasing slope just the point is pivot will have decreasing slope but that is the question itself how to find pivot but there is a very beautiful observation which we can make apart from the pivot being having a dip having a decreasing slope that observation is all of these values which are in the second segment are smaller than this particular segment and since all of these values are smaller than the first segment they will be smaller than the smallest element in the first segment which is 50. I will say all the second segments values will be smaller than array of zero, which is 15 this case. And all the values in the first segment in this segment will be more than or equal to 15. It will be more than or equal to area of zero. So this is how we are distinguishing between the first segment and second segment that is if certain value lies in the second segment, then that value will be less than area of zero. If certain value lies in the first segment that value will be greater than equal to area of zero. So right now the mid was what mid was hundred since mid was hundred. It is more than equal to 50. It means it is lying in the first segment since hundred is more than equal to 50. It lies in the first segment. Where should we go from for segment? We want to figure out the last element of the first segment. So we should go to the right side. Then only we will go to the last element of that first segment. That is the first part. So go to the right side by doing what by updating left as mid plus. one figuring out the new made 6 plus 10 by 2 which is coming out to be 8 index that is 16 by 2 as to the 20 value is it lying in the second segment or first segment is it less than area of 0 or more than equal to area of 0. You can say 20 is less than 50 since 20 is less than 50 it lies in the other segment which is the second segment and when you are standing on a second segment where you can figure out the maximum value on the left hand side because maximum value will be in the first segment which is in the left hand side so go to the left so go to the left means update right pointer as mid minus 1 check out the new made left plus right by 2 which is 6 plus 7 by 2 which is 6 index again ask is the 6 index value lying in the first segment or second segment you will say 110 is more than equal to 50 so it lies in the first segment first segment means you will go to the right side although what you can do is what whenever you are reaching on a element the middle index is reaching to a such element which is lies in the first segment, you can update the answer. Initially answer can be made minus one or maybe the value 50 you can initialize it with anything that is area of zero. Then you will say since mid was coming out to be first at 100 100 was better answer because it is better maximum 110 is even better maximum right now the current mid every time just update the answer with the maximum values. You will still continue the binary search that is go to the right side because on first segment value you will still search for the maximum value going to the right side but if you will do left as mid plus one you will figure out the new mid the new mid will come out to be seventh index which is value 10 and if it is value 10 you will say 10 is not more than 110 so don't update the answer but since you are lying on the second segment go to the left hand side if you will go to the left hand side where you will reach you will say right will become mid minus one and as soon as it is done. and right pointers have crossed each other left is at the seventh index right is at the sixth index so if you don't want to maintain the answer you can also do what you can just return the right index because that is a maximum value but answer maintaining will be easier because it will always give you that value actually you don't need value you only need index so first it will not be 50 it will be zero index then it will become the fifth index and then it will become the sixth index that is you just need to return index where the maximum is and as soon as you are able to figure out that index where the maximum lies now you know the two segments you know first segment is from zero till the answer zero till the pivot answer is nothing but pivot with zero till six and you know the second segment also which is pivot plus one till n minus one so apply binary search first in this segment zero till pivot and then in this segment to search whatever the target is if target is present in the first segment just return wherever it is present if it is is present in the second segment return wherever it is present maybe if target was 30 return 9 target was 80 return 3 however if target is like 25 which is neither present in the first segment nor present in the second segment then return minus 1 so apply binary search in total three times first time to figure out the pivot index this is the logic to figure out pivot then to figure out the target in the left range that is first range and then to figure out the pivot the actually the target in the second segment that is after the pivot so this is the approach which will take only logarithmic time because we are just applying three times binary search so it can be worst case three log n only which is still logarithmic and the space complexity will not be as such because we are not taking any extra data such that binary search is just algorithm without extra space lean logarithmic time and constant space solution which is the optimized solution we will write the instruction manual now corresponding to this approach So let's do what first step will be to find out the pivot so for that I am making a function which will return the pivot index I am naming the function as find pivot or find max index whatever the function name you want to give you will pass the array but although in this function you don't need to give the target because we are not searching for target right now we are just figuring out where the maximum element is present so that we can apply binary search to find target using that pivot index that is from 0 till pivot and then pivot plus 1 till last index so in order to figure out pivot we are initializing the answer we are setting the answer as what as initially 0 we can assume the minimum is present at the 0th index itself why to just consider it at any other index it can be that array is not sorted at all or not rotated at all if array is not rotated at all although the maximum will remain at the last index but we can initialize it with the 0th index also it is actually your wish each step we need to do every time we need to run a loop till the point left pointer is smaller than or equal to light pointer and left will set as initially 0 left is equal to 0 right is equal to initially n minus 1 where is n is array length it is self-explanatory run the while loop till that left pointer is either smaller or equal to the right pointer what we need to do in each step. We need to just say that is the current mid index first figure out the mid index which is nothing but average of left and right the middle value is it lying in the first range or second range and what was the comparison the comparison was with area of 0 whether the area of mid is less than area of 0 or it is more than equal to area of 0 if it is less than area of 0 do something else otherwise if it is more than area of 0 do something else first of all if it is less than area of 0 what was the segment it was a second segment and second segment is not what the answer we want we don't want the minimums we want the maximum. So we don't update the answer, however, we will update right pointer and make it made a minus one that is go towards the left side. So we will say in this if condition, if it is yes, then update the right pointer as mid minus one. However, in the else case, do two things first update the answer as the current index and also update the left pointer as mid plus one because we have to go towards the right side. If we are in the first range, go towards the right side to find out the maximum. So finally, once you are having the answer, just return that answer because that is the pivot index return answer. This is the first step. But now we need one more function which will actually do the binary search in a particular range. So I will say I will have a function which will find or search a particular element, but not in the entire array. That is, I will give the array, I will pass the target which we need to search. But along with this, I will pass the range in which I want to search, I will pass both the left as well as right pointers. Because sometimes it will be 0 till 6, sometimes it will be 7 till 10, sometimes it will be 0 till pivot, sometimes it will be pivot plus 1 till n minus 1. Now the binary search is a simple binary search. Simple binary search means run the loop till left is smaller than or equal to right, you already have the left and right pointer in the parameter, no need to declare them again. Just set the mid as left plus right by 2 and this time just compare the mid index with target itself. If array of mid is equal to target, do something, however if it is, let's say, we can say, in the second scenario it can be, in the second scenario it can be, else if array of mid is less than target, do something else or if it is greater than target then of course do something else. What we should do in the case of array of mid is equal to target? Target found, return the mid index because we need to find mid index, where is the target present, what is the mid index. index of that if target is greater so it will be found in the right hand side that is left will become middle plus one however if target is smaller in value it will be found in the left that is make the right become it minus one this is a simple binary search nothing to explain in this just the point was the finding pivot index so first in the actual function what you need to do first find the pivot so find pivot by calling function find pivot by calling find pivot function now whatever find pivot will give you first check in the first range if the first range will not give you minus one actually after the loop you have to return minus one the target was not found so if the target is present in the first range it will not give you a non-negative value it will give you a positive value or zero value so if the search in the range zero till pivot will give you non-negative value will be non-negative then what we need to do return that value return that answer. However, if the first range is giving you minus one then whatever second range will give you just assume that as an answer because if both ranges will give minus one then minus one remain answer. If first range is giving minus one. It means the target is not present in the first range and shortly it will be present in the second range. If target is not present in first range, then it will be present in second range only or it will be not present at all. So just return otherwise that search in the range pivot plus one till n minus one where again n is the arrays length. So quite a lot bit of code. However, time complexity even after a lot of code will be logarithmic space will be constant because we are just doing binary search three times in total the code for the problem search in a rotated sorted array. We have already written the instruction manual which are using three times binary search algorithm first to figure out mid and then to actually search. So we are using. The binary search in order to implement the question using the pseudocode using the instruction manual, we will write code in Java programming language specifically. So let's just directly jump on to the code part. First point is we need to first find the pivot by just calling the function pivot. I'm not implementing the pivot right now. I already know the function name, which is find pivot. What I will pass is the array which we need to find pivot in that is a maximum index. Whatever the maximum index is, just first find the answer in the left range. That is search the target in the array from left to right and left will be zero. Right will be pivot minus pivot only not pivot minus one, but pivot. If the target is present in this range, then well and good. That is, if this answer is not minus one, then this itself is the answer. So return that answer. This is what it is mentioned here. Let me just write it up a bit. However, if left range does not give you the answer. answer, then surely right range will give you the answer. So in the other scenario, just search for the other range. That is what we have discussed in the approach part. Also nothing to explain again. And you can say that, and it's num dot length that is number of elements. So what we need to do first of all, in the find pivot function, in the find pivot function, we have to find the index where the maximum element resides. For that, we are checking whether the mid index is a smaller than area of zero, or it is greater than area of zero, whatever the case is, we are updating the answer in the second scenario. So we will say initially the answer is zero. We will have the range starting from zero to N minus one, because this binary search will work on the entire array itself. However, the binary search will work till the point left is a smaller than or equal to right. Every time what we need to do, we need to just check whether the mid index. is smaller than area of zero or greater than area of zero. So first figure out the mid-index. The mid-index will be the average of left and right. Check this mid-index whether it is having value smaller than area of zero. If yes, then just do what? Then just do updation of right pointer, which is going to become mid minus one. However, in the other scenario, it is quite opposite to that. If it is in the other range, then do what? Sorry, in the other range, first update the answer and also update the left pointer and make it mid plus one. And finally return the answer. So let's just for now, print what the mid-index is giving you in the case of the first point pivot index. For now, just return minus one here. I'm just saying let's just print whatever the pivot is going to give us system. println pivot. Let's just see whether it is working fine or not. Then the other function is just a simple binary search. It is taking some time to run. Hopefully it should be correct for this array. If this is the array, actually there is some compilation error. What is the compilation error? Array name is nums and I'm using error. So let's do everywhere error only if we are just comparing with error. Let's run it again and see. So as you can see, the pivot index for this array is at the fourth index. That is the maximum value 0, 1, 2, 3 and you are actually getting 4. So something is wrong. 0, 1, 2, 3, fourth index we are getting. Although we need the third index because third index is having the higher value. So actually this is not the output which we are getting. The actual output is what we are getting. We are actually getting third index only. So I was wrong. wrong here actually the code is correct at least for the fine pivot so you can take a screenshot for the fine pivot function where we are actually just figuring out the pivot index which is the maximum element index once we know the maximum element index we can now search in the two ranges first in the range from 0 till pivot and then in the range from pivot plus 1 till mid minus 1 or actually n minus 1 so we will just apply a simple bind result that you already know I am just quickly coding this I will first do what first we find out the mid I already know the left and right as parameters just check whether array of mid is equal to target if it is equal return the mid index otherwise if array of mid is smaller than target then do the left as mid plus 1 however if it is otherwise then just do right as mid minus 1 so simple binary search let us run it and see to confirm whether our code is working fine or not then we will actually end the video so it is again showing some errors because our name is not now it is error. Let's just change the name and again run it. Hopefully it should be correct. Now, although the output which we are getting is wrong, the point is you're not supposed to print pivot. You're only supposed to print whether target is present at some index, otherwise minus one. So right now, as you can see, it is working as expected. Let's just submit. And already you can see all the test cases are passing. So this is the code. First find the pivot index, then do the search algorithm on the two ranges and overall time complexity will be logarithmic. Overall space complexity will be constant. That is a problem. And we will discuss a new problem in a new video. Till then, bye bye."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem set matrix rows and zeros we are given a m cross n matrix it means we are given a rectangular matrix where the number of rows number of columns can be different but what is given is if the element in the matrix is zero set its entire row and column to zero if we see any zero value make the entire row all the values become zero make the entire columns all the values become zero but one more thing which they have mentioned is do it in place that is modify the same matrix do not create a new one we have to change the original input matrix only we do not have to return any matrix we just have to do any changes whatever changes we have to do in the same input matrix itself so let's say the matrix which is given to us is 3 cross 3 metrics the number of rows number of columns can be same it can be different also like in the second test case as you can see it is 3 cross 4 and the values in the metrics are 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 that is whichever value are 0 in the matrix they are about to become 0 for the entire row and entire column so this value 0 will make the entire row and will make the entire column will become 0 that is all these values 5 mark all these values and all these values will become 0 that is why this all values are set to 0 and we have to do it in the same matrix similarly if I take the second example in the second example what is given as you can see we are given a 3 cross 4 matrix where this element is 0 this is 0 only 2 values are 0 so what will happen all these will become 0 all these will become 0 due to this particular 0 element similarly due to this particular 0 all these column elements and again these all row elements will become zero. These all values are becoming zero due to two zeros. It does not matter. So output is all these zeros, all these zeros, all these zeros, remaining all values are same as they were initially. So the question is how we can do such kind of modification. See, first thing which we can do in order to solve it is ignore the second line of the problem that is ignore that we do not have to do it in place. Let's say we are creating a new matrix. Why? We need a new matrix. If we are, if I am saying there is a zero make all the row elements make all the column elements become zero. What will happen? Let's see. In the same matrix which is given to us in the input one, one, one, one, zero, one, then again one, one, one in this matrix. If I am saying I am not creating a new matrix, I am just modifying in the same matrix itself. Is it zero? No. Is it zero? No. Is it zero? No. Is it zero? No. Is it zero? Yes. Yes, so make the entire row make the entire column become 0 that is I will set all the values in the same matrix in the row and in the column become 0 by running a loop over the row elements and over the ball of elements but when I will continue I asked to this one I asked to this one also like I will not ask it again I asked to this one whether it was 0 or not whether it is 0 or not whether it is 0 or not we have asked till this point now if I will ask the next element this is already 0 and if it is also 0 what will I do? since this is 0 I will make all of its row elements all of its column elements become 0 that is all of its row all of its column will become 0 we will continue is this value 0? no is this value 0? yes, so make all the column elements all the row elements becomes 0 finally this is also 0 so make all the row elements all the column elements becomes 0 but is this the matrix which we need? do we need 0 here? do we need 0 here? do we need 0 here? no reason why we are getting wrong output is since we are just modifying the same input matrix if any zero is making all of its row all of its column elements become zero and if I am continuing the updated zero element is repeatedly is recursively we can say just propagating the effect and making all of its row all of its column become zero this zero is propagating the effect so this any one zero will make all the row all the column zero those zeros will make more zeros in their rows and columns and this effect will go on and the entire matrix eventually or most of the matrix will eventually become having value zero and that will be wrong so what we need to do is we need to change the matrix but we can't do it in place right now as we are discussing the brute force what we can do it we can just create a new matrix while creating a new matrix will help let's see first of all I am just creating a new matrix with all the values same as the input one that is this is a zero and remaining all values are one now what we are what we are doing is it zero no is it zero no is it zero no is it zero no is it zero yes or maybe let's ask here is it zero yes so what we will do we will make all the values in the row of the first matrix that is the input matrix become zero and all the column become zero now we will ask in the copied matrix in the new matrix is it zero no but here it is zero we do not care we are asking here is it zero no is it zero no is it zero no is it zero no so finally we are able to make all the rows and columns become zero for only the zeros in the input initially which were there not due to ripple effect or not due to the recursive effect so creating a new matrix creating a copy will help us in this manner but what will be the time and space complexity as you can see that we were running a loop over all the cells of the input matrix or the copied matrix matrix and asking whether it is 0 or 1 if it is 0 then we are making all the row and column become 0 so what will be the overall time complexity first of all we are running a loop over all the cells so m into n time complexity and then making the all values of a particular cell due to a particular cell become 0 in the first matrix it will again run a loop for m plus n so it will be m into n into m plus n in worst case if all elements in the input are 0 it will make all the values in row and column become 0 so third loop will always run so overall it will be 3 loops 3 nested loops that's why it will be cubic time complexity what about space since we are going to basically take extra matrix we are going to take order of m into n space but the question is can we do it better can we do it without extra space or maybe in quadratic time complexity the answer is yes see since we are not allowed to change the same matrix or even if we are going to change it it will make the ripple effect it will make the recursive effect what we can do is instead of doing it in the manner that whenever we see a zero make all the values in that row and column become zero we will just for now store where is a zero present and then run a loop again to make all the values whichever had zero make all the values in row and column become zero that is run nested loops two times not do not run nested loop nested loop with three loops that is do not just say that as soon as I am seeing a zero I am making all the values become zero in its row and column and thus for now storing it in somewhere and which data structure should I actually use to store it since I need an information for all the columns for all the rows better will be to just create a boolean array that is whichever row contains a zero whichever columns contains zero so for that I am just taking a new matrix where I am going where I am actually taking zero here and in this particular matrix if I will do a dry run let's see how the dry run will work what I am doing is I am creating a Boolean matrix for all the rows initially none of the rows contain zero we do not know that whichever row contains zero or not so I am marking all the row as false similarly for columns array or the columns Boolean array we are marking all the false columns will be of the size whatever number of columns are there n and rows array will be of the size whatever number of rows are there in the input matrix and both of these arrays are Boolean arrays that is containing true or false initially all of them are false default values now what we are doing is it a zero no is it a zero no is it a zero no is it a zero no is it zero no is it zero yes since it is zero do not make all the row all the column become zero otherwise the same effect the same problem will come just to store that this row will become zero afterwards not right now afterwards this column will become zero afterwards so mark it true now continue is it zero no is it zero no is it zero no no no is it zero yes so do not make all the row and all the column value become zero otherwise it might go into a ripple effect it might go into the recursive effect just mark the row and the column values become true so that later on whenever we see a true we will mark the cell as zero now once we know that whichever rows have zeros whichever columns have zeros what we can do is we can just run a loop again on the matrix and ask should it make should we make it zero or not so should we make this cell zero why it should become zero if there is a zero in the column or there is a zero in the row we are doing in the reverse manner reverse engineering so is there the row becoming 0 no is the column becoming 0 no both are called so do not make it 0 should this value be 0 is the row having any 0 no row is not having any 0 is the column having any 0 yes column is having a 0 so we will make this value become 0 next should the should we make this cell 0 there is no 0 in the row there is no 0 in the column so we will not make it 0 should we make this one 0 yes although the row is not having any 0 but column is having so this 0 will make this all values become 0 so if there is a 0 in the row or column we will make the current cell 0 should we make it 0 yes there is a row element having 0 should we make it 0 it is already 0 because it is just marking both the true elements should we make it 0 yes the row is having 0 should we make it 0 yes row as well as column both are having 0 so make it 0 for about this cell make it 0 due to truth make it 0 due to truth due to column make it should we make it zero no there is actually yes there is a true in the row finally this is already zero so now what we are able to do is whatever cells should become zero only they are becoming zero due to the information being stored and not changed directly we are not changing the input matrix in one go we are doing two attempts we are running two times the nested loops both the times the nested loop will be the quadratic loops only that is overall time complexity will be two times m into n that is quadratic only and what about the space since this time we are not taking any extra matrix although we are taking two arrays one array of rows number of size another array of columns number of size the space complexity which we are using right now is order of m plus n that is three plus four in this case so this is the space complexity so we are not creating an extra matrix we are doing the changes in the same matrix itself and that is what the question is asking do it in place that is modify the same matrix do not create a new one yes we are following that although in order to do it we are just creating two boolean arrays that we are allowed we are not like we are do not want the space to be constant although there exists a solution which you can take up as a follow-up which will require constant space that is do not take any extra space at all that is also a solution possible but uh that will be a difficult solution for now so for this particular video we are coming up with this particular solution only this is the good enough solution good enough optimization so let's just directly jump on to the pseudocode or the instruction manual what we need we need to set what two boolean arrays so create or maybe initialize set two boolean arrays or let's first create a boolean array create a boolean array rows of size what of size M where M is the number of rows then create a Boolean array of size what of size column and the name of the Boolean array will be columns itself where we can say that M is nothing but number of rows and N is nothing but number of columns that is self understood because it is given in the question itself that the matrix is M cross N so first dimension is always rows second dimension is always columns and what we need to do we need to just now say first loop we will require to set the row value or column value become true if it is false initially so we will run a for loop over all column or first of all over all rows and then over all column first over all rows and then run a for loop over all the column and every time what we need to do check if the current value is zero or not so if the matrix value at the row comma column is zero then what we need to do make both the row and the column become true that is set true at the rows row index and columns column index and columns arrays column index columns column index that is the current row and the current column will become true now now when we know that whichever rows should become zero whichever column should become zero we will run again a nested loop that is we will again run two loops the same thing but this time to set the matrix become zero that is we will check if the row value is true if rows row index is it true or not necessarily and but anyone should be true or the columns column index is true that is either the row is containing zero or the column is containing zero containing 0 or both are containing 0 what should we do we should basically set the value at 0 set the matrix value at row comma column to 0 and once we are able to do it we are done because we have to just change the same input matrix we do not have to return anything so this is my instruction manual and we will be using it to write the code in Java language so first of all what we need to do is we need to create two variables m and n which are the number of rows and number of columns which we can do actually calculate in the terms of matrix dot length as the number of rows and matrix of 0 dot length as a number of columns so this is the way that by which we actually calculate the number of rows and number of columns in Java once we have it what we need to do we need to create two Boolean arrays as discussed in the approach video the first Boolean array will be named as a row and it will be of rows number of size that is M size second Boolean array will store all the columns having zeros so it will be of columns number of size with names columns only so once we have these two arrays what we need to do is first of all set all the Boolean values become true wherever there is a zero so we will run a loop over all the rows from 0 till less than M then we will run a loop over all the columns so first over all the rows then over all the column and what we need to check if any value is 0 make the value at the row and the column array become true if the matrix row comma column value is a 0 then what we have to do is just make the rows row index and columns column index become true so rows row index columns column index will become true so we can just write it in a single line by making both become true and same thing we have to do but now this time we have to do it in inverse order whichever value is a true in the rows or columns array make the value become 0 in the matrix so again we will run a loop over all the rows all the columns from 0 till less than m for rows and similarly for columns it will be from 3 0 till c less than n and we need to check this time that whether the value is true or not any of the value either row or column so if the rows of r is true or the column of c is true any one value is true just make the matrix value become true or we can not say true but you should say 0 so we will make the matrix value become 0 and that's it the approach is done we are able to do the entire thing let us run the code and see if we are able to actually print the resultant matrix which is required or not. The sample input one is giving me the same output. Let's also take the case where there are non zero non one values also that is values other than zero and one are also present. It should work for any kind of metrics any kind of values in the metrics. It is showing some kind of failed output. It might be due to the spaces which are there in my input but most probably the logic is correct. Let's just remove these spaces to see if the output is the same or not after removing spaces. So it is taking some time to run and as you can see it is showing success the same output as required. So let's just submit it and see if it is passing all the test cases or not taking some time to run but hopefully it will get accepted. So as you can see all the 19 test cases are getting accepted. What is the time complexity. the space complexity first of all if we talk about space since we are taking two arrays of m and n size the total space will be m plus n and we are not taking quadratic space we are not creating any new matrix but what about the time first loop for m into n second loop for m into n but these two loops will get added up because it is one after the other so m into n plus m into n that is two times m into n which is still m into n in big ODE notation that is a time complexity will be quadratic space is linear time is quadratic this is the solution although it can be optimized further with constant space where we can actually use the first row and the first column of the input matrix itself treat at as the rows and columns array but we have to make sure that whichever value we are making zero we should basically uh just store the original value whatever was there uh somehow like we have to take care of a corner case and the corner case should be if you are doing the constant space solution the optimization that what will happen for the top left element the topmost corner element so I am keeping it as a follow up you can try it and there are some other problems related to this like there is a problem named as saddle point there is other problems based on matrix where you have to do something with the boolean values but for now we are ending this video we will meet in a new video with a new problem till then bye bye."

It was then, a band of young, successful and highly driven people with a common link went on to shape the Silicon Valley as we know it today. This band of youngsters later came to be known as the PayPal Mafia, the celebrated alumni network of PayPal. Together, they are responsible for creating a multi-billion-dollar industry consisting of companies like LinkedIn, YouTube, Tesla, SpaceX, and Yelp. Almost a decade later, and 8000 miles away from Silicon Valley, in a city closer to home, a similar tale was unfolding. Ex-employees of the e-commerce giant Flipkart, a group nicknamed the Flipkart Mafia, dared to reimagine India's tech scene, resulting in the plethora of companies, many of which have now attained the coveted unicorn status.

        "transcription": "In this particular video, we will be discussing the problem linked list split. We are given a linked list. It means we are given the head of a linked list. We have to split it into two linked lists. So one linked list will have should be divided into two linked lists such that all the nodes with even data are in one linked list and all the nodes with odd data are in another linked list. So two linked lists can be said even linked list and odd linked list. Even linked list will be having all even nodes. Odd linked list will be having all nodes with odd data or you can say all odd nodes. But some constraints are required. Some constraints are to be taken care of. Make sure that the nodes appear in the same order in which they are present in the original linked list. What does this mean? It means if the input contains one, two, three, four, five, these nodes, then odd nodes nodes will be 1 3 5 in the same order and not 1 5 3 it should not be the order as random it can be the order or it should be the order which is same as the input order if input contains 1 comma 3 comma 5 as order nodes in the order linkage it should be 1 3 5 only same for the even it should be 2 comma 4 and not 4 comma 2 so again in this question we do not have to take care about the main function main function will take care about input and output itself we do not have to write it we only and only have to complete the function given in the code and we have to take the input as a parameter which is already given and take the output as a return type or you can say return the output and not print it structure should not so not be changed it means link list structure is already given to you you should not change it and you should not modify any of the already pre-existing codes if there are any otherwise test cases would fail so only and only one thing is that we have to complete this function stub okay input format there will be n nodes that is the number of nodes in the link list and then each node will be having some data and what we have to do is we have to print the link list first with odd element and then the link list with even elements so we have to return the two link list separately the link list with odd elements and the link list with even elements and as you can see if the input is 5 nodes having data 1 3 2 4 5 then the output will be first all odd nodes 1 3 5 are the odd nodes and all even nodes that is 2 and 4 in the same order in which they were in the input and you can clearly see that constraint will be that maximum number of nodes in the input link list will be 200 minimum number of nodes will be 1 so it might happen that one of the link list odd or even can be empty also if there will be only one node in the input it can be that output is a having only one node in the even link list and odd is empty or vice-versa. So we have to take care of that corner case also. Okay, but let's just do what? Let's just make a little bit larger link list and do a try run. Let's suppose there is 10. Let's suppose there is 13. Let's suppose there is 12. Let's suppose there is 18 then 17 then let's say 15 and then let's say 19. So these are the nodes given to us as an input. This is the input link list and what we are going to do is there are actually multiple approaches or at least I can say two approaches in which you can solve it either you can form the output link list having new nodes. You can create a new nodes and make the output link list have those new nodes or you can use the same link list nodes given in the input and just reorder them that is either create new nodes that is take extra space or if you do not want to take extra space you can just use the same nodes given as the input but in that case if you are. to modify the input nodes use the same nodes then the link list which is given in the input itself will get destroyed it will not be there as a uh return type or you can say it will be not there it will actually get uh divided into two parts itself so what we are going to follow in this video we are going to follow the approach where we are updating the input link list only that is we are not going to take any extra space because if we are not taking any extra space obviously we will reduce the space complexity so two things are there first thing is we need an odd link list and we need an even link list let me make them in different colors we want odd link list with odd nodes we want even link list with even nodes what we will do is we will take each and every node one by one from the input link list and insert it correspondingly either in the odd link list or even or in the even link list and since you might have learned of how a link list is being made it is being made using collection of notes collection of list notes with the head pointer and the tail pointer intact. So what I will do is I will maintain a head pointer of the odd linked list. I will maintain a tail pointer of the odd linked list same so odd head odd tail same goes with even head even tail. Initially what will be these four pointers I can surely say that even head even tail odd head odd tail all of these four pointers will be null. Why? Initially the odd linked list will also be empty initially the even linked list will also be empty both the linked list initially will be empty empty we will go to each and every node and just get it inserted into one of the linked list accordingly. So first node head is having data 10 is 10 modulus to 0 yes it is it means it is an even node and if it is even node we should basically insert it in the even linked list but since the even linked list right now is null it is the first node getting inserted so what should I do I should actually make the head node get insert it into the odd link list by simply making the head as well as tail become the head node. Head of odd head of the tail of odd that is odd head odd tail will become the head node of the input link list. So let's say that the head node of the input link list was the current node. So I am saying odd head is equal to odd tail is equal to current node. And now what we can do we can make the head is equal to head dot next head is 10 is equal to 10 dot next. So I am not actually cutting it. I am copy pasting it. Although we are actually just moving this node into the odd link list, but just to be precise in the visualization, we are just having the same node displayed here. Same node is there. It is not a different node. It is not a new node. The same node is just being also a part of the odd link list. And now I am doing what I am making head is equal to head dot next. Okay. Now 1313 is a actually one small mistake, which we did was 10 is a even node and we have inserted into the odd link list. it should be inserted in any one linked list so what we are going to do is we are going to rename the linked list let's just say the first linked list is even second linked list is odd a small like minor mistake while doing that anyways head now it is 13 13 is odd 10 was even 13 is odd means it should be inserted in the odd linked list and if it is going to be inserted in the odd linked list we are going to say since it is the first node of odd linked list head and tail both are null just make the head node become the odd head odd tail previously it was even head even tail now it will be odd head odd tail because 13 is the first odd node 10 was the first even node and now what we can do is we can make head is equal to head dot next we will be processing each and every node one by one okay now go to 12 12 is it odd or even that is even even means it should be inserted in blue linked list or you can say even linked list but now since it is not the first node going to be inserted it is the second node so I have to insert it in the last because we have to maintain the order why if the input contains 10 comma 12 output should also contain 10 comma 12 so this new node should be inserted in the last of the even link list so how can I insert it in the last I can say what is the even tail it is the node with value 10 even tail dot next is equals to the current point of the head pointer let's say this is not head otherwise you will get confused let's say this is current so even tail dot next is equal to current that is 10 dot next will become 12 and now since this is the new tail node tail is equal to tail dot next tail is equal to the 12 node so even link list will have two nodes 10 comma 12 or link list is only right now having one node and since I have updated that 10 dot next is equal to 12 in the input link list also 10 is not now pointing to 13 it is actually pointing to 12 only or maybe let me make it in blue 10 dot next is equal to 12 only because 10 dot next is equal to 12 okay so now I have updated for 12 I have inserted into the even link list make the current go to next node current is equal to current.next 18 again 18 is a even link list even node so it should be inserted in the even link list itself in the last to maintain the order so I can say whatever is the tail tail.next the even link list tail.next will be the current node so current node let me just copy it and insert it into the even link list by saying tail.next is equal to the current node and also tail is equal to tail.next why because now this is the new tail node for even link list so actually again since 12.next is 18 this pointer is actually getting destroyed and then again getting rebuilt 12.next is equal to 18 okay current should now go to the next node we are traversing on each and every node 17 it should be inserted in even link list that is whatever is the last node in even 13 13 node your next node will become 17 that is 13. tail 13 still is nothing but going to be pointed at 17. So let us copy 17 and let's just pay it in the order link list. And since 13 tails next is pointing to 17 tail should also get updated. The order tail should also get updated to the 17 node itself. So 13 is right now pointing to 17 again. Just make the current go to next 15 new node, which is again, odd node or node should be inserted in the odd link list. How in the last to maintain the order in order to maintain the order. We will take tail your next node will be the current node that is 15 node. So 17 dot next is equal to 15. And now since 15 is the last node, it should be tail. So tail is equal to tail dot next for ordering list. That is who is the next node of 17. It is 15 only. So this link is getting updated to this point only current will become current dot next finally for last node, which is 19, which is again odd node. So again, it should be inserted into the order. So I will insert it into the odd linkage by simply saying that the odd dot tail will be equal to the current node. So odd dot tail dot next will be equal to the 19 node. 15 dot next will be 19 and tail will also become 19 because now it is a last node. So as soon as I will say current is equal to current dot next, current will reach null. It means we are able to update all the input link list and insert them either in the even link list or in the odd link list but there is a small catch here. See very carefully. Who is 13 dot next? 17. Okay, very good. Who is 17 dot next? 15. Okay, very good. 15 dot next? 19. 19 dot next? Null. So for odd link list, superb. Everything is great. But when it comes to even, let's see, 10 first even node, 12 second even node, 18 third even node. After 18, who is the next node? Who is the next of 18? It is not updated. It is still pointing to 17. So 18 is next. is still pointing to 17 it is correct no it is wrong 12 next should be 18 but 18 next should be null because right now it is pointing to the original link list next pointer we should make it point to null by ourselves so the even link list null even link list tail node should point to null after it that is even link list tail nodes next pointer should become null same just for safety we can also do what the odd link list tail nodes next pointer should also be null set by us we should not basically rely on whether the last node was a odd node or an even node just for safety what we will do that even tail nodes next will also be null or tail nodes next will also be null in this fashion we will be able to maintain these two link lists and now we can return the two link list returning two link list means returning their head pointer so i will return the even head as well as odd head first we will return odd because the output order is first we have to return the odd odd nodes and then we have to print the even nodes the first we will return 13 output will be containing a array where first node will be 13th address and second node will be the 10th address that is the odd head and then the even head so this will be the output I hope the dragon or the approach is clear to everyone the milestone number two where we are using the same input language and as you can see we have destroyed the input language now input language is not single English it is just divided into two parts the blue part that is even the green part that is odd so with that we will be doing what we will be writing the instruction manual that is milestone number three so first of all let's maintain four pointers let's maintain or set odd head odd tail even head even tail all the four pointers as null initially none of the linked list both of the linked list odd and even linked list will be empty null Now, we will be traversing on the input link list. We can use the same head pointer itself, but if you are getting confused, you can rename this head pointer as current pointer. So I will be renaming it as current. So run a for loop, run a for loop or run a while loop. You can use any kind of loop, run a while loop until the current pointer reaches null. Current pointer, that is the head pointer. You can say it, I'm writing in bracket, the head pointer reaches null. As soon as it reaches null, we have to stop because input link list is empty. Like we have traversed each and every node, either inserted into the first link list or inserted into the second link list. So we will go to each and every node. We will ask whether the current node is an odd node or even node. So if current data is odd, do something. Otherwise if it is even, then do something. So if it is odd, we should insert it in the odd link list. But there are two scenarios of insertion. If it is a first node getting inserted, then both. the odd tail as well as odd head will be null. In that case, odd head as well as odd tail should be fed to the new node itself. If you are not clear that what I am trying to explain, you can watch the video link glitch insert. You can see that problem that should be a prerequisite. Why? Because in that problem we have discussed that how we can insert a node in the last of a link glitch. How we can insert a node in the front of a link glitch. The link glitch insert should be a prerequisite. Anyways, if the node is odd, what should we do? First step, if the odd head is null, if it is, then just make the odd head or and odd tail set odd head is equal to odd tail is equal to what is equal to the new node and new node should be nothing but the current node and we have to set the new node as the current node itself. So this is the corner case for the first node getting inserted. If we are not inserting the first node, then what we have to do is we have have to actually insert the second node onwards and if we have to insert the second node onwards we have to just chain the links we have to just chain the nodes and in order to change the chain nodes what we have to do we have to basically just make the tail pointer the odd tail we have to do what you have to make the odd tails next odd tails next set to what set to the new node the current node the head node or whatever whatever name you are using and update the odd tail as odd tail dot next as odd tails next node this is nothing but insertion at the tail node this is inserting a new node at the tail at the end same goes for the even if we are inserting for even that we will rename the pointers instead of odd head we will say even head instead of odd head even head instead of odd tail even tail instead of odd tail even tail and same here odd tail even tail that's chain the pointer names. So this is the insertion. Accordingly, if all the node is inserted, all the pointers should be updated. Or if even node is going to be inserted, even identity should be updated. And then we obviously have to update the current pointer. What we were doing in the pattern, we were making current is equal to current dot next every time current was going to the next node. So update current as currents next node as currents next node. Okay, this entire dry run when it will be complete, as we have discussed in the dry run itself, the corner cases, there might be the case that tail nodes next is not null. So we should make it null ourselves. So what do we have to do set the odd tails next, as well as the even tails next as null. So set odd tails next as null, set even tails next as null. And now we can return both the linked list in the form of head pointers, return the array containing first of all the odd head that is first the link list with odd nodes and then the even head that is the link list containing even node and head should be returned not the tail because link list can be traversed only and only if we are providing head node so this is the last three points after the loop so a very big code to be honest a very important question a little bit difficult question when it comes to writing the code without any extra space for this problem what is the total time complexity we are taking since we are taking a loop on the input link list either insert into the first link list or second link list in constant amount of time the linear loop will take linear time but insertion will take constant so overall time complexity will be linear only so time will be order of n but what about space as we have already discussed we are not taking any new nodes we are not writing any new keyword any anywhere we are not creating a separate node a copy of a node for creating both the split link list. So what you have to do is we have to take constant space in order to solve this. We will not be taking any extra space. Just use the input nodes itself in the output. Now in this board, we will be doing the inline expansion and we will also discuss about the test cases which can follow. So first, what we have to do is we have to set four pointers to for each kind of link list, the odd link list and the even link list. If you have not watched the approach video, you have to watch that only because otherwise the approach will not be clear to you. So let's let's basically initialize these four pointers. Head node is equal to null. Similarly, the tail node is equal to null for odd link list and same goes for even link list. So even head is also null initially and even tail is also null initially. All the four pointers are set to null. Now we will run a loop till the current pointer or the head pointer reaches null. So what I have done is I have renamed the current pointer. I have renamed the current pointer. rename the parameter variable from head to current. So while current is not equal to null, what do you have to do is you have to either insert the current node into the odd linked list or into the even linked list based on the data. So if current node is odd, how we can check it? If current.val, the val is the data. So if current.val modulus two is one, it means it is odd. And if it is not one, then obviously it will be even. So these two scenarios will be there, if or else will be there. If it is a odd node, then we have to insert it into the odd linked list, but there is a corner case. What is a corner case? If we are inserting the node for the first time, that is if odd head is null, then we are inserting it for the first time. In such a scenario, what we have to do? We have to actually set the odd head as well as the odd tail as both as the current node itself. Otherwise, if it is not the first node, then in the code itself, you can see in the... instruction manual that what we have to do we have to just insert it into the end that is odd tail dot next will be the current node and also make the current node jump to the next node actually odd tails jump to the current node so odd tail is equal to odd tails next so let's just do what let's just not write the code for the even case and do what let's just return for now a linked list or a not a linked list but a list for now we will be returning a list where we will store the head pointers of both the linked list so list of list node let's say the resultant name is res is equal to new r list and I will be storing both of the head nodes that is resultant dot add odd head and similarly resultant dot add even head because both the linked list will be represented by the head node and let's just return both the linked list for now by returning the resultant itself we have not managed the updation also obviously it will be go into infinite loop or you can say it will go into a time limited period error but let's just run it to see if it is uh showing me any syntax error or not so it is taking some time to run let's see okay so it is running but obviously it is going to time out error why because we are not updating the current pointer in the last what we have done in the last of the for loop we have also written one instruction manual step that is update the current and make it go to the next node current is equals to current dot next node let's just run it now now it will not go into infinite error infinite loop but still the error will be the wrong answer no syntax error but wrong answer is there why because my output is only for the odd nodes i am not able to get the output for even nodes because i have not handled the case for even nodes so at least this code is working fine same code we will do for even also that is if we are inserting the first ever node in that case head will be null for even link list and if that is the case the current node will become the head node as well as the tail node. So even.head will be even.tail both will be equal to the current node itself. Otherwise the same thing we have to insert it into the tail that is even tail.next will be the current node and the even tail will jump to the next node even tail is equal to even tail.next it will jump to the next node. So even if we run now it will it might work for the sample test case but let's just see what is the output and what can be the corner cases associated and what should we do. So actually it is not working for the sample test case also what is the reason see if there are five nodes 1 2 3 4 5 1 3 5 these are even nodes actually odd nodes and 2 and 4 are even nodes. So for even linked list it should be 2, 4 for odd linked list it should be 1 3 5 in the same order but what we are getting 1 3 5 2 4 5. why 5 is getting repeated in even linked list although 5 is odd the reason is after 4 in the input linked list the next pointer was 5 so we have not updated the tail pointers next as null we should make 4s next as null that is that two steps mentioned here so odd next odd tails next should be set to null that is after the last node of the odd linked list there should be no other node it should be null same goes for even linked list after the last node of even linked list the next node should be null that is that should be not chained with the odd node or any other node to be precise so if I will run it now after handling the corner case let's see if it is at least working for sample dash case or not yes sample dash case is working even if I change the order like even if I say there are 5 inputs and the inputs are 1 5 2 then let's say 4 and let's say 3 even if I change the order and if I still run the code let's see what is the code what are that it is taking some time to run let's wait for it to run and it is working fine for the other test case which I have manually input so let's submit and see if it is working for all test cases or not code is pretty big but some of the edge cases actually I can see is still failing and let's see why they are still failing why some of the corner cases are still failing what we have done is we have initialized all the four pointers initialized to null if we will run the loop till the point current pointer is not reaching null if the node is odd if odd head is null odd head is equals to odd tail is equals to current pointer yes this is okay otherwise we are inserting in the last the odd tails next is current or tail is equals to all right dot next yes very good otherwise if we have to insert a even node it should be inserted into the even link list in that case if the first node is inserted even head will be null so make both even head as well as even tail as current otherwise just insert it into the last that is eventail.next will be current eventail is equal to eventail.next and every time make the current pointer go to the next node. So this while loop is perfect according to the instruction manual. Let's just now see these two syntaxes where that is odd tail.next is null eventail.next is null. Yes. So there is one more corner case which might be failing. We have not opened the test cases which were failing just from seeing the code. You can also figure out that if in the input link itself there is no node containing even data. There is no nodes which are even. So in that case what will be even head or even tail it will be null null.next in that case will give you null pointer exception. So before doing the even.next is equal to null you should be sure that even tail itself is not null. If even tail itself is null do not do this because null.next does not exist similarly for odd link list. In the input link list, all the nodes are even one. Actually let's say the input link list contains two, four, six. In that case, all the link list will be empty. And if all the link list will be empty, then the odd head will be null or you can say all the tail will be null. And if it is the case, tail, if it is null, null.null again will give null pointer exception. That's why we need to check it. If it is not null, then only make the next pointer null. So let's run it now after handling the corner case. So it was a very beautiful corner case where there are no even node or no odd nodes. It can also be possible. Let's submit now if it is working for all the test cases or not, including the corner cases. So it is taking some time to run and yes, it is now working absolutely fine. But as we discussed in the approach video, what will be the time complexity of this for loop? Since inside this for loop, all of these operations, updating current pointer, next pointer, tail pointer, all of these operations are constant. This while loop will run for total number of nodes that is order of n time. and this is again just constant amount of time operations. So in total the overall code's time complexity will be linear where n is the number of nodes and input linked list. Space complexity since we are not using any extra space since we are just using the same linked list and splitting it into two parts space complexity is also constant not also but it is constant and time was order of n linear."

        "transcription": "So, like, and the transition, was it smooth? It was not. So, I'd go on through the whole journey of, you know, starting from zero of arrays, tags, queues, etc. Right? And going until, like, graphs, PPA. So, you had this transition from Accenture, then to Deloitte, and now you are, like, into an academy which is, like, not so, you know, the normal journey. So, it's not like that. So, how did you make it up? Like, because Accenture is, like, a totally service-based company. And how did you grow from there? Like, you know, how did you take it up? So, I'll talk about when I was in Accenture. So, again, I didn't have any mentor. So, I was just looking, exploring around, and I came across Harvard's one course, which was, like, CS50. It's taught by David Cheney. That's the best course there is. I think everyone would agree. Yeah. So, that was the one. wherein I thought that whatever I studied in college, that was more theoretical. Let me just go through it. What is it that these people are learning, right? People in Harvard, MIT, Stanford, right? So, I just went through that course and I just did a commitment that I'll ensure to cover this course up, right? And it is a 12-week course and I was able to, you know, close it in, I think, 6-8 weeks with all the P-sets, everything. And what I used to do... Like, how did he get that focus that time? I think it was more about the hunger. I wanted more of it. I wanted to know more and there was a hunger of, you know, I want to solve better problems, etc. Usually, when you get into service-based companies, you know, whatever task that you get or whatever work is coming up, you're just doing and just done with it. Usually, like, all of my colleagues, they used to come back, they used to sleep, they used to go for party. But at that point in time, you know, I was very much focused around, you know, I used to come back around 8-9, whatever. And... And then after like dinner and so I used to, you know, go through those courses and cover up those P sets. And this used to go be like, you know, three or 4 a.m. in the morning. Like so you wouldn't have that peer pressure, like they are going to four parties, man. No, no, no. No. Because those, see, you might feel some days, but then I found more interest into the problems that I was solving. I think that's the hardest part, to get that, because it's a very hard part to decide, like, I want to do this, because that life is also good, right? Like, because I want to enjoy that also, but. Yeah, but that is like temporary pleasures. Those are all temporary. You have to think long-term, like I think Abhishek did very well. I knew this, that in life, you have to get into one place. Either you get into IITs before college, etc. Or you get into college, you get better placements. Now I knew that I made blunder there, right? I was not there, right? So then I knew that, okay, now I, at least I'll have to, you know, put in my, this thing. Because. I believe, if anyone is at any place, right, if he has reached, you know, some level of better place in terms of the work that they have done or the contribution that they have made in the industry, it is because of a reason. They would have done something better and that's why they are there. So, that had struck and again, I was, you know, following around like CE jobs and all of these guys were always an inspiration. And the way, David Chamel and CS50, the way he teaches, that energy itself drives you. Actually, yeah. I would give more credit to him. I love that in the phone book, he had like torn that phone book and he was explaining that algorithms work. I would give more credit to him rather than, so mine was only 30% of it. So, that means like you kind of treated him as a mentor and you try to follow him like that, right? Yes, yes, yes. So, mentor played a, you know, very big role in your life. Yes, yes, yes. To look up to him. And then you made the transition. to Deloitte, Deloitte what you were working as? Yeah, so Deloitte again same software right and but but then this was little better than you know what I was doing at Accenture but then when I was doing that again it was more like service based and I had come across couple of people or colleagues you know who were talking about working in product companies and they were talking about the problems that they are solving and things like that so and I always had this thing initially when you start you know you have this thing yaar kutka kuch karna hai ki yaar main do saal kaam karunga I will learn how things work and then I will make something of my own but then you end up in this trap of you know always working because every year acha something new you are learning right so that was always there and that's where I think I ended up joining Zest Money where it was pure startup. So like and the transition was it smooth? It was not, it was not so again when you do go to a product based company again we were discussing. Just before the podcast, DSA, algorithms, all of it you have to prepare and this thing. So yeah, initially I went through the CS50 course and then when I was transitioning to the startup, product based companies, you know, the interview process is completely different. The service based company would focus on more of the language, semantics, etc., right? However, product based companies would focus on your problem solving process and that would come a lot from the DSA and problem solving. So I'd go on through the whole journey of, you know, starting from zero of arrays, tags, queues, etc., right? And going until like graphs, TPA. So did you do lead code and all? Yeah, I did do that. I was doing hacker, hacker, hacker rank and lead code, meaning I was doing a mix match. So that's where I ended up there. But then I understood it's a journey, right? It's not about, you know, coding. and then you have to, you know, mug up how the problem are solving. It builds up a thought process of how to break down a bigger problem statement into smaller and then how do you solve it. So, that is what the product-based companies are mainly, you know, looking for. They want people, if given a problem statement, they are able to break down and they are able to solve it."

It was a lot more holistic as well as it was very personalized. I got to know that there is a particular way to complete a software project. Here the projects are pretty much like what we get when we have a client project. We get to do modules and you know add a particular functionality to a project. Even a beginner who just started with the language or just knows the basic is able to go ahead. and learn step-by-step. I see a lot of things in my current company which go online which I am learning and Cryo and that has helped me and also made me understand things a lot. You know, learning how to debug, learning you know whenever you you're stuck how do you get past a problem that's where the you know Cryo's methodology helped a lot. Things like being comfortable using the terminal, these are things that I use today and overall I think it just made me a much more confident developer."

        "transcription": "on the front-end side when you are doing the Q-profile, right, and today I want to just like make sure that you're all very comfortable kind of at least understanding what is this back-end about like and how to create a REST API back-end. This is specifically useful for people who have never ever done a back-end like a REST API back-end because some of the things that you might think are very hard kind of like frameworks made them very very easy and there are some structural differences in the way you program when you are actually doing a REST API back-end. I'm going to quickly help you understand that creating a REST API back-end is not really too hard and also just like clarify some of the questions around this. Alright, we'll get started. I'm guessing it might take about 40-45 minutes and I'll also try to take some questions. Alright, just give me one sec. Yeah, so this is where we are. You are already enrolled into XMEME and if not please do let us know. most of you are already done and today we'll be starting with the rest api backend 101 and on monday there will be one more session around odm and orm and how you can actually connect a server to a database all right again you don't have to write queries or anything there are tools that would actually just like convert whatever you write in a specific language let's say java or javascript or python right they directly convert that into db query so it becomes extremely simple all right uh so let's start with a very quick exercise so far you have been learning what is http rest uh and you have also deployed a server in aws now one of the things is uh look let's check out how good you have understood some things okay so when you open a uber app right uh what exactly happens it displays the cars around you right like let's say you send some sort of a location from your gps and something is going to happen post that wherein the Uber server is going to return you back a list of cars that are say present around you. I'm just like talking about the home screen. Click on this bitly link, you can actually just like pause the video, click on this bitly link and then you can actually go about writing down what you know in terms of the whole flow right. I'm not talking about the UI flow, I'm more interested in the technical aspects of it as to you send some lat long to the Uber server, how do you send it, what sort of data do you think that you are sending to the Uber and what happens post that. Alright, feel free to pause the video, okay and then just like try it out, fill the form and then you can continue with the rest of the session, alright. I'm going to just like copy, you can just like note this one and then you can go to this bitly link and then continue, alright. Now, if you were to think about the whole. packet flow right so from your uber app it's going to issue a REST API request right you are probably aware of that already and it's going to probably send some parameters right it's going to send say your latitude longitude right and maybe you are looking for all the cars that are available or maybe close to completing a trip something along those lines but you know that now it's going to be a REST API request and by default HTTPS means it's going to be on port 443 right so to quickly to quickly summarize first like a DNS resolution is going to happen for api.uber.com and then the HTTPS GET request is going to be sent to the particular server for which you get the IP address and on port 443 all right it reaches the server till then I hope all of you are completely clear right you have tried it from browser you have tried it from curl right so you should be knowing till this point now what exactly happens over here. There are several different things that happen. So we are quickly going to see what are the various things that need to happen and then how frameworks help you make life much much easier. Initially I'll just like do a couple of quick things and then I'm going to show you some code in Java to just like help you get familiar with some of how the languages work. First thing at a high level if you see someone has to listen on the port 443. Somebody is sending a request, the client is sending a request. So who processes that packets on the server? So that's a first step. Then the server, whoever is listening on the port, they have to do some processing. If it's a HTTP packet, they have to do HTTP processing. If it's a MySQL server, then they will do whatever processing MySQL server would do typically. And this particular thing usually you go for some standard off-the-shelf servers. Like Tomcat is a HTTP server. Similarly, there are several different HTTP servers. Especially if you are thinking of a REST API endpoint, you would go for one of the popular HTTP servers. And then the HTTP server receives the packet, and then it has to do quite a bit of processing post that. It has to understand whether it's a GET request, POST request, PATCH request. If there are parameters within that, like how do we retrieve some of those parameters, all those things have to be done. And finally, I'd actually just quickly take you through the code on the server side. And I'm going to use Java as an example. I'm going to just demo it on a live editor. You can also do something very, very similar, using Python, Django, Flask, Node.js, Express.js. You can actually do the same thing. All right. OK. First and foremost, you have to run through the. packet comes from the uber app right to a particular server somebody has to be there listening on the port right otherwise who would process these packets some process has to be there could actually listen on those ports correct so how do we check that i'm going to go to the workspace okay these are describe a workspace and then if you were to see i can just like quickly tell them to any port okay i'll say localhost 8080 means that somebody is running over here what it says is it is trying to establish a pcb connection with my localhost on port 8080 if there is somebody listening on the port okay so there are differences between a server running and somebody just like listening on the port okay if somebody is just like listening on the port port then you would actually get something like this ok end of day it's a TCP connection nothing more than that ok I'm going to just like try a different port let's try 8081 it clearly says that unable to connect because and the connection is refused which means that there's nobody running on this particular or listening on this particular port number right so somebody is listening on port 8080 but not really on port 8081 all right similarly if you are thinking of a production server usually it would be reselling on port 443 you can try it for any of the common servers if they let you connect you would be able to get to port number 443 ok so which means that any server where you are doing www.something.com you should be most likely be able to do this as well all right now I just like show you that listening on a port doesn't mean they have to be a HTTP server there's something you have to understand very clearly all right so there is a command called mc with which you can actually listen on any port okay I'm going to use 8081 because you see that the connection was refused on this port right I am if I do this it means that it is going on this command is going to create a TCP listener on this specific port okay I'm going to go to a different terminal localhost 8081 earlier we had a connection refused because no process was listening on the port now you will see that there is something happening a TCP connection got established does this make sense so far okay now next steps we are able to do this now as I said here a process listening on a port doesn't mean it is a HTTP server it could be anything right your mysql can listen redis can listen you can just like have an nsync command listening on a particular port. A process can definitely bind to a port and listen to it. Now, the thing in the case of a REST API endpoint is that it has to have the capability to process the HTTP request, right? Because at the end of the day, you're sending a HTTP request with GET, POST, all these HTTP works. So the server should be capable of processing that. Now, do you know how to check whether a particular port is capable of processing HTTP request or no? All of you know, right? You have tried that using the GET command by constructing a TCP request, right? Sorry, by constructing a HTTP request right on top of a TCP request, right? In the HTTP byte. Now, I'm going to just like do that. I'm going to just like try this command, right? Get localhost, the particular port number, greeting, and then some endpoint, right? So So, I'm on the port 881, I'm going to just paste this, see if I'm getting any response. You can see that I'm actually not getting any response from the port number, I'm not getting anything back, so this is the TCP listener and then from here I'm actually sending the HTTP request, I can type something and you can see that the same data is actually reflected over here, but this is the listener and the other one is the person who is initiating the connection, requesting for some data. You can see that whatever I sent from there is just like nearly getting printed over here because it's an end of a PCP socket, nothing more than that, nobody is able to process this information. When you actually have a HTTP server running, when you type the same get command from the other side, you will actually get a HTTP request. response okay let's see how that works okay now I'm gonna quickly go to the server right which is running right now I'm gonna just like quickly go over here so this is I'm going to just like start a HTTP server in Java that's it okay I'm gonna just like run this now I'm gonna run it in debug mode so that I can show you more so it's starting a HTTP server and then it's listening on port 881 all right you can see that it started a Tomcat server and Tomcat is a HTTP server and then it started designing on port 8081 all right now let's go back to the same same guy okay now I'm gonna do I know that I have started a HTTP server right I'm doing the same thing and then I'm gonna copy paste the same get command. Now I get a response back. You can see that I'm doing a HTTP request on and then with HTTP 1.0 and then I'm getting a response back from the server because there is a HTTP server running on the other side. Okay and it says hello world all that thing whatever the server is going to respond back is actually sending me the response. Okay so hopefully this part is clear where I'm any the summary is that you can listen on any port all you need is a process it can a process can listen on any port. You listening on any port doesn't mean you have a server that can process any data that comes to the port right. One for you to process REST API packets you need to have an endpoint that can process all the HTTP requests right and so you by default by generally whichever uh language you use you usually go for something called a framework that will give you a http server automatically you can use tomcat or other nginx etc like there are several http servers that you can use which will actually help you process these risk tpa packets all right now next step so we are actually talking to a http server in this case right and then next step is to understand how do you process these requests right you are receiving a http request from the other side and you know that the http request can be of different types right there are different http requests you can have a get request you can have a post request you can have a patch request correct you know that by now you have got that request into the http server which for which you have written the code or you are using a standard tomcat or whatever what you want. Now the Tomcat server is processing all the process like it is processing the some parts of the stuff like it process the HTTP protocol it receives the HTTP packet. Now you need somebody to take things from there right you have to write program to actually process these how do you go about doing that to receive the packet but like now you know that Tomcat can actually understand the HTTP protocol but what next right do you want to write how do you go about say differentiating what is a get request what is the post record just like of plain programming right you get some requests you get a packet that has a HTTP uh it's a HTTP packet which contains all the details of HTTP request header the method name all these things it contains how do you go about processing all those right now you have to have some logic right to differentiate you have to extract right all the query that gets sent as a part of the request how do you get that and then process that right so are you going to write code for it how about the json and the post body this is a json string right proper string now you don't want to deal with strings you want to deal with only some kind of a variable right in your language so for example if such a json is coming on the in the input right like let's say that somebody you want to actually do you're doing a post request from your client and then uh the the post body contains the json data now you have to read this data into your language maybe you can write a string parser that reads say name as santa credit card number assist and then you are having a function that does all the process but if you were to think of it whatever we just like discussed like say getting the query param getting the post body param right the the data right or let's say you have to return 401 kind of error or 404 kind of errors right all these are standard for every single recipe server you have to get this you have to get this data so which means that most likely somebody is going to have written some library which would take care of all these right remember earlier we saw if you had to parse based javascript object right there are usually libraries to do that or the language natively supports that similarly there are something called frameworks okay that almost all languages have which help you process a rest api packet all right it simplifies your life so that you don't have to worry about the http server you don't have to worry about how to get this data right from the from the http server into your language you don't have to worry about how to process this JSON data and then how to kind of transcribe that or transform that into your Java or Python objects right all these are usually taken care by frameworks so that you don't write have to write code for all these it otherwise it becomes messy right you have to do a lot of unnecessary things you can think of them as libraries or frameworks which will actually take care of all these all right there are several such frameworks spring boot is one framework python django is another python flask is another express is there right so there are several and go also has plenty of such frameworks right each language most likely is going to have some sort of a framework for you to build st page in a very very easy manner okay I'm going to use spring as the example and then walk you through how it works okay. now you can see some java code don't worry if you don't know java it is actually immaterial ok i want to cover certain aspects which is common across all programming languages ok so let me just like quickly move into full screen alright so over here you can see that i have a main function ok you don't have to worry about anything else over here all you care is there is a main function which is similar to what you would have in any other program right and i'm going to quickly comment out a line and then just like run this program ok or all of you are used to running a main program right like when you write any code and hack around all this right now what happens after i click on run you have a main and then you are printing something out what will happen when you do this right typically whatever you print you you print it and your program ends correct if I run this my program will end just like it will print this and then the program will go to termination which means that if I do a PS or something the program will not be there anymore right like say here I do a PS the program was not there anymore right I can do PSAUX which means script forward processors that's very wonderful existing processors and I mean just like checking for certain things and I think most likely these are probably not the ones that we want but like the point here is that you would not have anybody running once you are done I'm guessing it's probably showing something for all right so now if we were to come on these two lines out right like uncommon these like what is going to happen is instead of running a program where the main runs some commands and then completes it's gonna start a server Correct. So if you think of REST API packet, when you open Uber app, you click on the home screen, and then it's going to send a request, and then you might get a response back. Think of it from the Uber server side. It's not like whenever you send a request, somebody is switching on the server, and then they are starting the main function. It will run for a few seconds and then shut down. Somebody has to be there on the Uber side, 24 bar 7. Somebody has to listen on that port, 24 bar 7, and then keep responding to any incoming requests from any clients from all over the world. Correct? Which means this particular process has to run forever. It's very different from your typical main process where you do X, Y, Z. If it's a prime number program, you make a simple calculation, print things out, and exit. But when you're talking about the server, it has to keep running. keep processing whenever there is a request that comes in it has to continuously listen on whatever port it has advertised outside if it is running on 8080 or 8081 it has to consistently listen right on that particular port so that anytime anybody randomly comes and talks to it it is able to respond back okay so we are kind of moving away from the notion of running a program to completion to running a program that is just like staying there forever that is a key difference how to understand which means the typical flow that you are used to right let's say that you want to know how the program flows okay what is the usual thing you'll do you'll go just like go set a break point here like let's say I'm going to just like copy paste this again so if you want to debug this program how do you go about debugging it right like i'm going to set something over here i'm going to just like do a debug it's going to come here right and then i know that if i do this it's going to go to the next step right because it's a synchronous line of execution correct this happens after that there is the next line that is going to execute but when you are talking about a server this is not what it happens right you have started the server and then waiting for requests to come in which means you have to find out the entry point for the request and you have to set the break point there instead of over here that is the first and foremost difference right i'm going to just like stop this server and uncomment this okay delete this line now let's run the server in debug mode okay i'm going to just like remove this breakpoint as well you can see that the program it is continuously exiting it's not quitting the terminal like there's something running and you can see that it says started a state service application in some seconds it is listening on port 8081 and you can see that there's nothing over here like the program has already gone past this point right it has printed even will I be called has already been printed that is actually after starting the server this particular line just assume that it starts some server and then listens on port 8081 your main function is already done right it says will I be called also gets printed which is coming right after the server start you don't have to understand the syntax just understand this line starts the server and then the next line also gets printed however the program is not ending at this point right it's still running something right you can see that it is still running that is a difference between the asynchronous kind of servers that is up and running waiting for instructions versus a synchronous program that runs to completion. Now next thing is I need to know where the requests come in. Correct that's where I have to set the breakpoint. I'm going to go to that particular place in this case I have taken a very simple greeting controller okay so over here this is the greeting controller I'm going to set the breakpoint over here. Okay now how do you know this is where you have to set the breakpoint. So each language I'll show for a couple of languages as well each language has a way for you to tell where and which which API endpoint it should listen on for example if you are talking about Java okay this rest controller annotation in Java you have something called annotations if you are used to Python it is similar to decorators okay so this particular annotation and this this particular annotation tells java or tells spring that hey I have a function and this function will process any HTTP requests that come to this particular endpoint that's what it says okay if somebody is trying to do localhost slash greeting then you have to call me is what it says all right so I just like show you that as well okay so this is what we are doing here I'm actually connecting to localhost 8081 greeting okay I'm gonna press enter you can see that my command the control came to here in the server all right you can see that it is actually coming to this line from here on it is no different from any program you write it if you're you're just like not putting every code you write in main instead you have functions but from here on the way the server behaves is exactly like how a regular code that you write will behave. Okay the only extra thing you have to do is get the request right like whatever is part of the request body whatever is part of the URL whatever is part of the query param there is a way for you to get that from Java or from the Spring Boot framework other than that you are going to write plain normal code okay that is something for you to remember alright so as you can see I'm able to connect to this and similarly if I say greeting one okay I don't have any greeting one over here which means that it will not actually result in anything because nobody is going to process the particular endpoint because nobody is saying I am the one responsible for processing greeting one endpoint right so what you are doing is inside your program you are telling the framework in this case it is Spring framework but depending on whatever you use that hey I have some code that can process whoever hits this endpoint is what you are saying okay I'm going to quickly show how this happens on the other languages okay so you can see that if you are using Express you do something very similar if it's a GET request on this particular URI then call me types okay if you are looking at Django again very very similar it has something called a router and then you do something very very similar again over here right let's see here you are saying okay if somebody hits this particular endpoint right or they have say localhost slash colon 8081 slash article slash 2003 then you call this particular function There's a bit more nuance, but I'm saying at a high level, this is how things work. It's not as straightforward, but easy enough. For GET you do something, for POST you do something slightly different, but the high level idea is that whichever end point, URI end point that you want to process, you just like simply associate a function with that end point. And each language supports its own way of registering a function or attaching that function to the end point. Okay. So this is Python Django. And if you're looking at Python Flask, it's very similar to Java, where it also says a route. It's like slash greeting. Similar to that, it's saying slash hello, which means that somebody hits that point is going to call the hello function. You can also see more such things, right? If it's like route, and then there is a way for every language, every language supports a way for you to get these parameters as well. So this is a path parameter. So the language itself the framework itself provides a way for you to get this as a variable inside the language. All right so fairly straightforward all you have to do is understand the high level picture that the framework does bulk of the work which means that once you understand the framework a bit essentially start by writing a greetings controller in whatever framework you choose every framework is easy right whatever framework you choose first write a greetings controller understand how to get the request understand if you are able to print the request out understand if you are able to print the query params out are you able to print the body of the request right are you able to return something very very simple back if you do these three or four steps then you would be able to write the api in a comfortable time all right now let's get back i want to show you a couple of more things um so over here as i said here you can see that java provides a way for you to read the request params. So if at all you give I am going to just quickly run this ok if at all you want to pass a parameter right you can actually give testing going on for path query param right this is query param I am going to just like do this then it comes over here I am going to go to the next step and you can see that the value over here will be the same value that you are passing over here right the name for whatever is the name if you were to look at the name variable right I am just like watching the name variable it says testing going on for query param. So which means for even for getting the query param I am not writing any logic right as a programmer I am not trying to parse this or do anything fancy all I am saying is I am instructing my library. language to pick up saying that hey whenever there is a name as part of the query param get the value to me ok just one second folks i think there's some problem with streaming just one second ok so that is what happens and you are able to just like with the simple annotation you are able to kind of express that to the java and then the variable name is copied over all right uh just one second just one second folks it seems like there's some problem with streaming i'm going to quickly check that Thank you for joining me. All right, so I hope this this point is clear. There's another point right let's say that I'm actually making a POST request all right and how does that get the data right if I'm making a POST request with some kind of a JSON body right how do you process that data because query param you have got something over here similar to what we do over here even if you're having a POST request you can actually convert the JSON data whatever JSON data you are getting you can convert that JSON data into a java object that is done using some of the standard libraries like Jackson which will convert a JSON into java object or back which means that if you are passing this data right name Santa credit card number something right as if you're just like posting this request and then the moment you give this specific annotation in java right it is going to load the data into this particular class it is going to automatically load the data into this particular populate the JSON data into name into credit card number that is done automatically you don't have to do anything to achieve that all right so the summary to summarize the frameworks are extremely powerful which helps you start your coding only after you get all the data from the HTTP request it provides a way for you to send back the HTTP response back in a very very clean way and also it provides you to do that in a way that you already know right so all the things where there are you have to process string or you have to process query params etc is automatically taken by the framework usually all right so I just like start playing around with it if you are kind of interested in doing this on spring you can actually take a byte that is there in the byte page it's called spring boot byte from where you can actually get started as well if you want to do it in a different platform like language, maybe Python, Django, or Express, that is also fairly straightforward and then going to be very, very simple. So this is what I wanted to cover today, hopefully it just provides you some sort of a rough idea of how to actually go about building a REST API. And I think feel free to have any discussions on Slack as well. And hopefully, you know, you are kind of going to be completely comfortable building REST APIs. And then try to start with a greetings controller, if you have never done, okay, don't just like jump two to three steps, start with the greetings controller, get comfortable with the flow before going further. All right. Thank you so much, and all the very best for your next stage. Thank you."

        "transcription": "So I was always interested in coding, but in the college placements, I got the opportunity to work at Oracle, so I took it. I worked there for two years or so and I was happy with it, but the thing is I always wanted to work in core development role. This was more on a maintenance kind of role, application maintenance and customization kind of things. I wanted to work in core development where I can build new features, I can add functionality to the product, etc. My name is Sahidu Nagar, I am from Surat, Gujarat. I did my college from NIT Surat in Applied Mathematics, 5 year integrated MSc. So I was working on bank specific customization, application maintenance, data migration, all that for last two and a half years. In Cryo I learned a lot of things. Main thing was I was able to practice regularly of the questions and everything because of constant guidance and all, so that was a good thing. And I started getting referrals for like the last two months or so and recently I. I gave 6 to 7 interviews properly in the companies where I, after my resume got selected and after the initial call, I got shortlisted for like 6 to 7 interviews and I recently landed one job in a company called Centalytics, there I am going to work as a Senior Associate in Engineering, so SDE2 kind of role, those were like instructors at Cryo. So I found that like all the instructors were working in well-established companies. I hope that since they worked in those kind of companies and they were teaching at Cryo, I could also get that knowledge from them. So that was the main deciding factor that the instructors were already working in big MNCs and big tech companies. Main thing I liked about Cryo was the workspace experience. It was like very well-structured codes that were given, very well-structured requirements were given where we can think by ourselves what we have to do specifically. In the meantime, while connecting with mentors during let's say Q&A session or in the main session itself, they were like very friendly. helping I was solving problems along with them in the session itself and they would help in like they would give inputs not exactly to direct solutions but to let us think give us the direction in what what way we can think to such kind of problems like the thing is when I was interviewing at Centalytics I had one interview with the CEO as well so he told me like they are starting a new team in AI and I could be working with that team as well so yeah I'm pretty much excited to like embark on this new new technology new project that that is like a hot topic in the tech world right now"

And also, the most I enjoyed in CRIO is that the self-learning. In CRIO, we were taught how to write a clean code. My code is very much readable and less buggy. We did the externship project also. That helped me to gain the confidence and become comfortable about the technologies. I will ask anyone to be patient if the results can't be obtained in CRIO. days, it takes time, you're just be consistent."

        "transcription": "I always wanted to go into either SDT or into software developer role, wherein I could utilize my 100%. Since I'm from QA background, it might be a bit of a hurdle. In QA, I didn't have the confidence of development, though I liked it very much, and I was hoping that Cryo would help me push. I enjoyed with the full stack track. When I was doing the projects earlier, I was facing a bit of difficulty. I talked with the Cryo counselors as well. In the starting, it took a lot of time to debug and all, but after the first module, I was more confident. After the second module, I gained more perspective. In the third module, I gained more traction, and by the time of the fourth module, I was more confident. I also started exploring things from references, reading books. Therein, I worked on one stack specially, so I wasn't very in touch with data structures. to development, I've practiced DSA and it helped me gain some regularity, continuity, which is important in development. The projects that I worked upon helped me learn many things towards development. And when I started with Cryo, slowly by slowly, one person daily, I started to gain confidence. I'm not just a developer, but I have the mentality now that I can develop things by myself and with the team as well. People who aspire to be developers, they can take this from me that if they have the discipline, if they have the direction and if they follow the path of Cryo, they would definitely have the right track and they will gain the confidence to develop things and they would be able to do complex things as well."

        "transcription": "So before cryo, I was basically, I was a kind of developer who you would want to speak a spoon feed, right? Like tell him, take this approach or follow this. So basically I did zero research for my own self. If you would give me a complex problem statement, I would get overwhelmed. I would only think of, you know, getting away with some brute force method and just go along with it. Once I joined the program, I knew for a fact that let's see, even if I get stuck for really long, I will have something, someone who can give me a hint at least, or guide me to the right track or tell me, okay, you're taking a wrong approach, you take the right approach. So this kept you motivated, even though you were stuck at a project. When we switched to Java, there were projects related to Java and cryo, right? And it obviously got overwhelming at the beginning, but, but the team, like the mentors who were behind us, who kept pushing us, I knew eventually I'll reach the goal, right? And that kept motivating you, like, you know, you'll be able to finish. For a fact, when I knew that I will become a software developer, like, or I want to pursue this, when I did the first project from Cryo, which is QBox, that's like, I got exposed to file transfer protocols and stuff, like in hand, right? And that was very interesting. Like, I didn't know that I would be working on things like this before, like in college, I just knew what FTP was, but I never did enhanced stuff. Yes, for the interview, the tips I got, right, like how to improve the confidence I gained and the resume writing skills I gained, everything did help me post Cryo, right? I was more confident in attending interviews and like, I knew what my value was and what I would be contributing to the company. Before Cryo, like, I wasn't aware, like, how I will be contributing, I just saw myself as a pressure. Like, okay, if you're hiring me, I will just do it. someone who will come in non-stop from your office. It's actually nice, you know, like it's a virtual thing. Everyone's working towards same goals and we pretty much had same working hours also, right? And you know, for a fact, like let's say morning, you don't feel like working, you can go ahead and work at night and there will be someone working with you at the night. And you can basically discuss like how you're tackling this and all. It gives you, it basically expands your, the way you look at the problem. Apart from the resource channel, which we had, they're so helpful, like people, whatever they found online, which would help us eventually down the line. Let's say not even interview, like let's say advanced stuff, everything was shared, like literally, you could just go there, open any link and just keep increasing your knowledge. For a matter of fact, right now also, I go through the resource channel and there are some important links which are saved with me. reading stuff so yeah the community was amazing that's that's that's the main thing like which other students also should be looking for it's okay to keep learning right i mean even if it's slow just keep asking stuff i mean that's that's the approach i took right like even if i didn't understand something in in the online sessions which you guys had just keep asking doubts even if you don't understand just keep the best way is to just get your hands dirty you have an amazing community who's motivating you achieving same goals amazing mentors learn by doing that that's what defines"

I believed that I will get some good opportunities through Cryo. So I left with my offers and joined Cryo. Before joining Cryo also, I was continuously applying to companies and getting rejected every time, sometimes in interviews, sometimes my resume. So then I thought I need to nourish my skills and all. I started with the, like the flow of Cryo. Cryo's projects were scalable. These are almost similar to real world projects. Before joining the program, neither my code was clean or neither it was more understandable. There was a lot of mistakes in my code. While going through the modules and working on the projects, seeing the things in project like documentation and all, I learned to write more clean code. My quality of code was improved after this program. I used to analyze how much tasks or modules I can complete. After achieving those goals, it took around five months for me to complete the program. If you go through all the modules given in the interview preparation it will be really helpful. That covers most of the things which are required. I plan to get a job opportunity as soon as possible. Referral experience was really good. I got around 40 to 50 companies within those 15 to 20 days to apply. Within 15 to 20 days, I got the offer from the company which I worked in."

        "transcription": "In this video, we're going to learn about the structure of a webpage. Now structure of a webpage is built in hypertext markup language, which is nothing but the HTML. And how do you write the structure in HTML for a webpage? You can do that easily with the help of tags. So this is a general example of how your HTML structure looks like. So can you see that there is an opening HTML tag, a closing HTML tag, within which we have kept some more tags, like the opening head tag, the closing head tag. We could keep some more content in this head tag as well. Similarly, we could keep some more content under this body tag as well. So the HTML head and body over here are known as tags. And the best practice is to always start your HTML files with a doc type declaration to tell the browser which kind of document you're expecting. Now what do we mean by this doc type? here. Well, this specifies that the HTML content that we have in our file is going to follow the standards of HTML 5 version. Now, the latest one that we are having for HTML is HTML 5 itself. Now, if you don't put this at the top of your HTML file, also means that you're going to follow the standards of an older HTML version, which might not be supported by the latest of the browsers. So, as a good coding practice, you should always remember to put this doctype HTML at the top of your HTML files, right? So, this is how the structure of a webpage looks like. So, under the HTML tag, you're going to keep the complete structure of your webpage. Now, the first part of it contains the head tag, which also contains the title tag within it. If you can notice over here, the complete structure is present inside a set of tags. Now, under the head tag, we had a title tag, which contains some content. What is that content? content page title. This is going to be the title of our web page. Similarly, we added some headings and some paragraph tags under our body tag. So all of these are going to be available on the web page as headings and paragraphs respectively. So now take a careful look over here. You want to share this video with your friend, which is this YouTube URL. So whenever you do that, do that on WhatsApp, what exactly happens? This kind of a pop up appears on the basis of the link, right? It might contain the URL of the link or maybe the title of the video and so on and so on. Now, how exactly WhatsApp gets to know about what is the URL and how exactly is it trying to show this particular information? Well, that is going to happen with one of the tags available in HTML. Let us discuss that as well. So under HTML, let us first of all, summarize all the tags that we have learned. So every HTML HTML page will generally have the HTML head and body tags. These are the most commonly used tags in an HTML file. Now HTML will enclose all the page content as we have already discussed. It is also called as the root element of this HTML file. Now under that we will first have the head tag which will define all the metadata and the title of the page. So you can contain the title as we just saw in the previous example. We can also contain some metatags available over here. So the example that I've shown you for the WhatsApp that it is able to capture that URL or the title of the video, it happens with the help of metatags. So with the help of metatags you can have some additional information available about the webpage which can be used by crawlers of the search web engines or maybe tools like WhatsApp to share these kind of details so that it looks as a more interactive link. Now it can also be handling the form. wants for the page by providing certain styles and different things as well. Okay, now what will the body tag contain? It will contain the content which is displayed inside the browser window as a page. So in the previous example we saw that h1 tag and the p tag right? All of those content is going to be available in the body which means this has to be displayed on the browser window as a web page. So to understand all of these things let us now go to code sandbox and see a practical example for the same. So how do you start writing your html file? Well at the beginning you have to specify doc type html. Well code sandbox also provides you with the help of some suggestions or you can type it in manually as well. So this is the very first thing that you specify on your html file. This tells the browser that whatever code you're going to write is going to follow the standards of html5 which is the latest version of html. After which I want to get started with the HTML tag. Now code sandbox again support some of the shortcuts to prepare these stacks. So even if you write HTML and hit a tab, it can auto complete this thing for you, but you can also write it down manually. Now under HTML, I want to have my head tag and I want to just close it over here as well. And inside which I would like to write a few things. Now inside my head tag, I would like to keep first of all the title. So this is how I'm going to write my title tag. I'm going to say structure of a web page. This is what I want to give us the title of my web page. Now what else can I keep in the head tag? I can also keep some meta tags available over here. I can specify what is going to be the language which is going to be followed by this particular web page or what is going to be the character encoding followed by this web page for which I can say. a meta tag with an attribute associated to that. So I can say meta charset equals utf-8. As of now, we don't need to worry about what is this utf, it is nothing but the character encoding, but this just specifies for the HTML that this is going to be the character encoding followed for the same. So this is how you write your meta tags. So on and so on, you can write multiple meta tags at the same place as well for denoting different set of things. Let's say you want to keep a description of your web page. You can say something like a meta name equals description and then content equals learning about structure of a web page. And then you can just close on this meta tag. This is also you can how prepare the meta tags as well. Now, after this, I can also prepare. my body tag, but my body tag is supposed to be outside the head tag, which is going to be at this place. So let me declare a body tag over here. Okay, I am writing it here and closing it here. In between, I can write some content. What is that content going to be? Let's say I want to have a heading. So for heading we have an h1 tag. I can say this is a heading. This is a heading and I can just close this tag. I can have a few more. Let me also have a p tag available over here. This is a paragraph and I can also close the p tag now. So if you're carefully able to notice, the whole thing is a structure itself and the complete structure is in terms of some tags and the complete content will be under some enclosing of the tags itself. So if I just save this now, you can see the content is rendered over here. was inside the body tag was only rendered as a part of the browser's web page. Where will the title and everything go? It will be the title of the tab where you're going to open this particular HTML web page. So only the content that you write under the body tag is going to be a part of the actual web page. So this is how overall the structure of a HTML web page looks like."

        "transcription": "Now we will try to understand the logical operators in Java. What are the logical operators? Let's take some examples and with that we will try to understand. Let's say you want to take a loan from a particular bank. We want to take a loan from a bank. If you will try to take a loan from a bank, will they give you a loan directly or will they look out for some conditions? Everyone pause the video and try to think through it. Yes. So in order to provide you with a loan, they will look into some criteria. Mostly in general world scenarios, they will look out for your salary. Yes, that will be first pointer. And apart from that, they will also look out for your Sibyl score or we can call it as credit score also or let's consider it Sibyl score only. So these two are the criteria which mostly all the banks will look out for. So, let's say our condition is if salary is greater than 100 rupees and and your civil score is greater than 800 then. If your salary is greater than this particular amount and your civil score is greater than 800 then you are eligible for loan. Else not eligible for loan. So, if your salary and civil score they both are greater than 100 and 800 respectively, if your salary is greater than 100 and civil score is greater than 800 then you are eligible for loan else you are not eligible. So let's try to understand this further. Let's say my salary and civil score. I'll just create a table and we will try to predict the output. Let's say my salary is 90. My civil score is 750. Let's try to analyze if I be eligible for a loan or not. Okay. So let's check is 90 greater than hundred. Is this true or false? 90 greater than hundred. So this is false. How about the second condition is 750 greater than 800. This is also false. Since you did not fulfill both the criteria will they provide you loan? No, so it will be not eligible. Let's look at second condition. Your salary is 120 190 and civil score is still 750. So first one is true. 190 is greater than hundred for sure. But second one is false. True and false. True and false would be you did not meet both the criteria, right? Again, we did not meet both the criteria. So it will be not eligible for loan. Let's take third scenario. It is 190 and let's take this value as 850 is 190 greater than 100. Yes, that is true is 850 greater than 800. That is also true since you have fulfilled both the criteria. What do you think will be output just pause the video and think through it. Yes, this time it will be eligible for loan. Let's look at one more condition. Let's say the salary is 90 and your score is 850 is 90 greater than 100. No, this is false. Is 850 greater than 800 is this true? Yes, that is true. But since again, you have not fulfilled both the criteria one is true and one is false your overall output will be not eligible. True and false since you did not fulfill both the criteria. so bank will not provide you loan. So can we simplify this and write A and B as the conditions? Let's write A and B as my conditions and let our output be output only. So if first condition is true, second condition is false. The overall output will be false. If first condition is false, second condition is true. Again, the overall output will be false. If first condition is false, second condition is false. The overall output will be false. If first one is true and second one is also true. If both the conditions are fulfilled, your overall output is going to be true. That is what we have validated in our example as well. If both the conditions were true, then only you will be eligible for loan. Else you are not eligible for loan. So you have to fulfill both the criteria. So this particular logical operation, this type of logic. logical operation where you have to fulfill both the conditions is known as and operator or and logical operator in Java. This is your and logical operator. This is your and logical operator where you have to fulfill both the criterias. Let's try to write the code for the same problem statement. I will create two variables in salary is equal to let's say 90 in Sibyl score is equal to let's say 800 or 850. If so inside our if block we have to write two conditions now, so the first condition will be on top of salary if salary is greater than hundred and so the and logical operator is denoted by two ampersand symbols and Sibyl score. Is greater than hundred. than 800 and if salary is greater than 100 and Sibyl's code is greater than 800. We will just have a normal print statement that is system dot out dot println println eligible for loan else system dot out dot println not eligible for loan not eligible for loan in this particular scenario. Let's check for both the conditions is 90 greater than 100. Is this true? No, this is false. Let's have a look at second condition is 850 greater than 800. Yes, this is true, but first condition is false. Second one is true. So overall output will be false. Let's run this and validate. So the overall output is false. Let's modify our input. We will make salary as 190 and we will try to validate is 190 greater than hundred. Yes, this is true is a 50 greater than 800. That is also true since both the conditions are true. Let's try to predict the output now. Yes, since both the conditions are true overall output will be true and it will be eligible for loan. Now we have looked into one of the logical operator that was and logical operator that is both the conditions have to be fulfilled. We have to fulfill both the criteria. The second type of logical operator is your or operator or logical operator where either first one or second one has to be true and your overall output will be true. Let me repeat myself. If any of the conditions are met right let's let's say in the previous example only let's say if only the salary was greater than 100 or your credit score was greater than 800 you will be eligible for loan. So we will only look at one condition only one condition has to be true at least one condition has to be true. Then your overall output will be true at least one condition has to be true. So let's predict the output here first and then we will try to code this ok. So first condition is true and second one is false is one condition at least true yes or no. Yes at least one condition is true. So overall output will be true here. Also first condition response. Second one is true since at least one condition is to overall output will be true over here first condition in sparked second one is also false. Since both the conditions have called overall output will be false. Here at least one condition is true. So that is why overall output will be true. So that is the impact of your logical or operator or means at least one should be fulfilled. If at least one is fulfilled your overall output will be true. So we will stick to our same example where we will modify our logic instead of fulfilling the both conditions, right instead of fulfilling both the criteria that is your salary and Sibyl score. Now, this particular bank has decided even if your Sibyl score is greater than 800, you will be eligible for loan. We will not check your salary or if your salary is greater than a hundred rupees, you will be eligible for loan. We will not validate your Sibyl score at least you have to meet one criteria at least one condition. Okay. So let's stick to that same example. I will take salary as 90. Is 90 greater than 800? Is this true or false? This is false. Okay, we will take. many second example is 850 greater than 800. Is this true or false? This is true. 850 is greater than 800 first condition is false. Second one is true false and true. At least one condition is true, right? Since at least one condition is true. The overall output will be true and you will be eligible for loop. Let's run this and validate. Yes, since at least one condition was true. You are eligible for loop. So this is second type of operator that is a logical or operator or operation at least one condition should be met. Now we will try to look into the third type of logical operator that is your not operator. Not the name itself suggest that is the negation of something not negate invalidate something. So let's see this is my condition. and this is my output. So basically if your output is true, if let's say your condition is going to return your value as true, right? Your output will become false. It will just negate the output. If the outcome was true, it will become false. If the outcome was false, it will become true. It will just negate the output and in order to negate the output, we will use this exclamation mark. This exclamation mark will basically negate the overall output. If your input was true, if the condition was true, then the not of true will become false. If your overall output was false, that is not of false, it will become true. So it will basically negate the output. Let's take the previous condition itself. The overall output of false and true was true, right? And we were getting output as eligible. Now, let's negate the that I will add this not symbol and enclose everything in round bracket. So this inner round bracket what will be the output of this inner round bracket excluding this not symbol. Yes, the inner round bracket output will be true. So basically I want to find out not of true. So what will be the output of not of true it will be false. So this inner condition this part. Let me write down overhead. This part is going to return you true. So I have done the negation of true. So negation of true will be false. So your overall condition will become false in this particular scenario. So instead of getting output as eligible for loan, you will get output as not eligible for loan. Let's run this and validate. The overall output is not eligible for loan because have negated it that is your logical not operator."

        "transcription": "In this video, we will go through the concept of string comparison in Java. Okay, so there are two ways to compare strings in Java. First one is using this double equals to sign. Everyone pause the video and try to recall where exactly you have seen this double equals to sign. Yes, so let's say you will declare two integer variables in A is equal to 10 in B is equal to 20. If someone will ask you to compare their values, you would actually compare with a double equals to B, right? Yes, this is how you will compare two integers or any other primitive data type to be precise. This is to compare any primitive data type but string is not a primitive data type. String is non-primitive data type. So in case of a string rate if you will specify double equals to let's say you have a string. S1 is equal to let's say ABC and string S2 is equal to ABC. What happens in this particular scenario? If you would write S1 double equals to S2, it will actually look for memory location. That is if they both are present in same memory location or not. So if S1 and S2 are present in same memory location, your output will be true. So if S1 and S2 are present in same memory location, right? Your output will be true else it will be false. Now, so everyone pause the video and try to think through it. Will you actually want to compare the memory location in normal use cases? Let's say I want to validate the password or I want to validate the email address. address so for those scenarios will you wish to validate the memory location or the value everyone positive we don't try to answer. Yes, we would actually wish to validate the value right value not the memory location. So that is why Java has given you equals method. Equals method. Equals method is used to compare value. It is used to compare value not the memory location. So if you would write s1.equals s1.equals s2 it will actually check if s1 and s2 have same value. So I want all of you to pause the video and try to think through it. Does s1 and s2 have same value here? Yes, so s1 is also equal to ABC s2 is also equal to ABC. So since they have same value. value your output will be true. So just to summarize right your double equals to compares the memory location. So S1 will be occupied in some memory S2 will be present in some other memory location. So your S1 double equals to S2 will look out for memory location, but S1 dot equals S2 will actually check for if they have same value or not. Now, let's talk about Java and their memory allocation. So in case of Java right whenever you will declare two strings like this S1 is equal to ABC S2 is equal to ABC your reference variable S1 and S2 will be pointing to save memory location where ABC is stored. So to be precise it will become like this. Let's say this is my memory where ABC is stored. This is where ABC is stored. So your S1 double equals to S2. S1 reference variable will also occupy to memory location 20 and your S2 reference variable will also point to memory location 20. So they both will be pointing to same memory location in this particular scenario. That is why your output will be true in this case also. Let's try to look at few more examples and we will try to understand it better. Let's see we have a string S1 is equal to Sachin and string S2 is equal to Sourav and string S3 is also equal to Sachin. So basically S1 is also Sachin, S3 is also Sachin and S2 is equal to Sourav. Everyone pause the video and try to predict the output in line number 6. So the output in line number 6 will check the value because it is equals method. So S1 is equal to Sachin, S2 is equal to Sourav. Is it the same value or is it different? Yes, they both are different values, right? So your output will be false in this case. It will basically check for value. Now, let's come to next line that is double equals to now see if they both have same value if they both have different value for sure they will be present in different memory location in same memory location. You can't store two values, right? Let's say you have this lad. So on the same land, can you construct the house and a hotel also or you can construct one thing only one thing only right? You don't have that in a plan. So same concept applies here. You have a memory location. So in that memory location, if such in his present, Saurabh will occupy another memory location. Yes. So if you will check s1 equals to s2, do they have same memory location? No, it will be false because they both are pointing to different memory location. They they both are different values. So for sure it will be present in two. different memory location. Okay. Now s1 is equal to such in s3 is also equals to such a now. We have equals method. It will check for value. Do they have same value? Yes. So your output will be true. Now in case of Java as I mentioned s1 and s3 reference variable, right? They both will point to same memory location. Where such in this store. So here also it will be true in this particular scenario, but every time in Java if you have to check for value, make sure that is you equals method not double equals to sign every time. Please try to maintain this because you are checking for value not for memory location. So always go with equals method. Now, we will run our code and validate our output. So we are able to validate the output whatever we predicted. We are able to get the. output. So this completes our discussion around the string comparison concept. Thank you everyone."

        "transcription": "Hey, this is Rathina, co-founder at Crayo.do. This is Career Cafe. Today, we're going to discuss some of the most frequently asked questions while working with thousands of tech aspirants in the last four years. In the last four years, we at Crayo helped thousands of professionals to transform into great tech careers with better job roles and better earning potential. In this process, we have learned a lot of curated insights and learnings. Today, we're going to discuss some of the most frequently asked questions and share my perspectives there. Let me pick the first one. It is, can anyone get into man companies? Can I do it? Let's dive in. This is one of the most commonly asked questions from a lot of learners. Everybody wants to get into man companies. The question is, can I do it? The answer is, anyone can do it. It's not impossible, but there is a lot of factors, right? We'll discuss. Let's discuss an example. Let's say, take an example of a user named Amit. Amit works for Infosys. for last three years. He is working in a production support project for a US bank. He does a little bit of Java coding, not a lot of coding. It's mostly maintenance of small bug fixes and he's out of touch with programming and he comes to us and says, can I get into Google? My question to him would be, this is a very, very broad goal. Can you be more specific? In what time frame you want to get into Google? He says, I want to get into Google in 18 months. Can I do it? My honest answer to him is, no, it's not possible. We have less than 5% chance that you can make into Google in 18 months. The reason is, looking at his background and his problem solving skills and programming ability and his experience, things cannot change over the course of 12 months alone. And if you look at the applicants who are coming to Google, right, in other words, it's going to be a combination of a lot of profiles coming in there and who can actually get in. I tell him, it's not possible. What can you do next? He asked me, okay, can I get into? Probably I'm willing to work with you really, really hard for 18 months and improve my problem solving skills, improve my programming skills, improve my portfolio. And I want to get into, let's say, one of the multinational banks as a Java back-end developer. Can I get into Bank of America? Can I get into Stanchart Bank as a back-end developer in 18 months? My answer is, yes, you have a 60 to 70% chance if you work with a platform like Cryo, and if you really, really prepare well, you can definitely get in there. Let's say Amit joins Bank of America. After working in Stanchart Bank for 18 months, or Bank of America for 18 months, and continuously preparing and improving his problem-solving skills, can he get into Google? The answer is, he can. The chance is 60 to 70%, right? So the point here is, anyone can get into Google, or for that matter, any top-tech company. The only thing is, you have to be very, very practical in what path you're taking. It's not always about one step. It's not always Google or I'm not going anywhere, right? A lot of times, if you have a goal, which is very, very overwhelming, you may not make a forward progress, right? So have incremental goals. So at Cryo, we strongly recommend people to have... the ultimate goal but have a path right one step not just as you not necessarily one step have a two step or three step process to reach that goal. That's all for today folks if you have more questions leave them in the comments we'll pick them up and put in the questions bowl see you in the next video"

I wanted to learn technologies like this Node and React. So I had a talk with my multiple friends. So one of my friends recommended this. When I went to Cryo websites, I was actually surprised and more excited to know that this platform is more focusing on project-based learning. There were some live sessions where mentors were teaching us. Whenever I had a doubt, I just simply contact them through Slack or through phone. I'm learning new stuff day by day. After this program, I feel that I will be able to make a scalable microservice API using Node with a good knowledge of front-end technologies like React. Overall, it's a very good experience till now. you"

        "transcription": "Hmm, how does Google's autocomplete work? Well, actually, autocomplete predictions reflect all your past searches, trending topic, location, language, as such as all the possible completions of the letters you've typed so far. In fact, autocomplete saves 200 years of typing time every day. So how does autocomplete work in Google Search? Google uses a data structure called tree that stores and organizes word. Each node in the tree represents letters. The pathway from the root node to least node forms phrases and words. So when a user types out a query, the system can travel down the tree based on the end node letter. It efficiently narrows down the possibilities based on prefix matching. All of this is possible due to the power of data structures. So that's why when you start typing what does, then Google autocompletes it to what does moe moe mean. Moe. Moe."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video, we will be discussing the problem which is nothing but find the maximum sum possible out of all subarrays of size k what we are given is an array of integers and number k a single integer k find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k so what do you mean by first of all a subarray it is nothing but a contiguous section of an array where all elements should be in the same order so if I take the 4 elements 100 200 300 400 out of these 4 elements one of the subarray can be only 100 it can be 100 200 it can be 100 200 300 but you can't take a subarray 100 comma 300 because you can't skip any element in between that is the meaning of subarray contiguous elements should be there and also you can't change the order even though we are going to find the sum of the array or a sum of a subarray. subarray so order does not matter but still when it comes to the definition of subarray if the subarray is 100 comma 200 you can't make it 200 comma 100 so it should be in the same order so find such a subarray whose sum of all elements should be the maximum but second constraint is subarray should be of size k these two constraints are there so if i will just remove all of this if i will maybe we can say i have a array let's say 20 is there let's say 10 is there let's say 80 is there let's say 70 is there and maybe 50 is there let's say 60 is there let's say 30 is there let's say 40 is there and one more value which is 70 is there so these are some values given to us and let's say the k value which is given to us for which we need to find the size of the subarray is a 4 the size of the subarray should be 4 and such a subarray should have the maximum sum of all the elements present in that subarray. So if you will talk about the array containing how many elements there are as you can see roughly 8 elements n is equals to 8. So in our area of 85 how many total subarrays would be there the total number of subarrays will be n into n plus 1 by 2. So it will come out to be 8 into 9 by 2 and if you will calculate the actual answer it will come out to be roughly 35 36 subarrays. So in case of 36 subarrays if you are finding all of them and then checking which subarrays is having the maximum sum how much time it will take figuring out all the subarrays will be taking n square time and then finding out the sum of that subarray will take another loop that is a linear loop inverse case n square into n one of the approaches the most brute force solution would take n cube time first generate all the subarrays and then out of all those subarrays check the length of the subarray and also the sum of the subarray and find such a subarray whose sum is is maximum and the length is also equal to K, but what you can do is you can try to optimize this code into n square by just using the prefix concept. So let me just quickly show you how you can do it. Initially you will say the sum is zero because the initially subarray will be empty first take the element 21 element taken is it of one length. The subarray is not of one length. You can make a count variable also, then you will take the next element. The subarray will become two length starting from zero, but still it is not having four length K length. Take the next element which is having some 80 having value 80 the sum will become 20 plus 10 plus 80 number of elements are three still not equal to K take the next element. Now the elements are equal to K. So whatever the sum is coming out just store in the maximum also initially maximum you can initialize it with anything maybe you can initialize it with zero that is the empty subarray or if the input might contain negatives. Then you can also consider the minus infinity as the maximum initially that is initially the minimum possible value is the maximum answer. So I am I can also exaggerate it with minus infinity and update this value as the maximum but now what we need is the next subarray and to find the next subarray of 4 length of k length should we consider more elements in the same subarray is it any use so it is actually going to give me subarrays of more than 4 length, 5 length, 6 length, 7 length and so on. So obviously it is not good to consider more subarrays starting from 0th index so what we can do is now start a subarray with 1st index that is now take the subarray take the sum of 10 then 80 then 50 then 60 then similarly the next subarray take the sum of 80, 50, 60, 30 then similarly take the sum of next subarray 50, 60, 30, 40 so one by one if you are going to find all such subarrays. kk length first of all a loop will be required to finding all those subarrays a second loop will be required to find the sum of all the elements in that subarray so overall what will be the time complexity the time complexity will come out to be first loop for n that is for the entire array into the second loop for k size only it is only running for four times it is only running for four times so you can say the second loop will actually come out to be k so you can also say it is n square or you can directly say it is n into k so starting from cubic solution where we are having two loops for subarrays start pointer end pointer and a third loop for the sum of the elements and that's a very we are able to optimize it to n into k but is it still the most optimal solution and can't we just do it in maybe linear time is there any need to have a two loop solution a nested loop solution the answer is we can do it in a single loop also or not just single loop you can say we can do it in a linear time also. The point is let's say the first time I was calculating the sum of these four elements the next time I am calculating the sum of these four elements. Let me mark them in green the tick marked elements next time which four elements I am figuring out the sum for these four elements next time which four elements I am figuring out the sum these are these elements and so on. Let me mark it in red. So one by one your sub array is changing but the size is fixed but what is the observation since the sub array size is fixed going from the previous sub array to the next sub array instead of calculating the sum by running a loop can't we just use the previous sub array sum that is let me just undo all of this let me just remove all of these tick marks and everything what we can say is if I in the previous approach if I am running a loop to calculate the sum of first sub array what you have to do still because for the first sub array you have to find the sum of all the elements. the elements which is 20 plus 10 plus 80 plus 50 of size k k is 4 in this case but for next subarray what is the next subarray next subarray will be from first index till fourth index do we actually need to run a loop again and calculate sum of 10 plus 80 plus 50 plus 60 and there is no we don't need to run a loop again why because some values are repeating as you can see 10 plus 80 plus 50 these three values were also there in the previous subarray these three values are also there in the new subarray of the next you can say next four size so this subarray is having 10 plus 80 plus 50 here also it is 10 plus 80 plus 50 what is the new value which is added the new value which is added is 60 what is the value which is being removed the value which is being removed is 20 that is this element 60 is being inserted the element 20 is being removed while going from subarray 0 to 3 to the sub 1 to 4. We are removing one element. We are inserting one element or you can also imagine like this first the subarray was this next the subarray comes out to be this as you can see this element is going out of the subarray. This element is coming inside the subarray. So one element is getting discarded from the subarray. One element is getting included in the subarray include exclude principle or including you include exclude strategy. So actually you can consider the subarray as a window and this window is getting shifted. So this approach is famously known as a sliding window technique and that too with a static size a sliding window with a fixed size static size. So static sliding window technique we are actually following. So what we are going to do in the most optimized solution. We are going to just say the new subarray some can be used or can be calculated by using the previous subarray some that is if I talk about this subarray we can just use this sum actually this entire. sum from that entire sum reduce 20 that is reduce this element and add the new element. So let me just write it again instead of doing this what we can do is whatever the previous sum was let's say this is X so in the value X subtract 20 and add 60 so let's say this value comes out to be X dash or let's say this value comes out to be Y so for next sub array which will be from the second index till the fifth index this sub array will have these four elements so while going from this sub array to this sub array what is element getting removed 10 is getting removed what is the element getting inserted 30 is getting inserted so in the value Y remove 10 and in the value Y insert 30 or add 30 so remove one value add one value remove one value add one value and this window will get shifted each time initially the window is 0 to 3 next the window is 1 to 4 next window will be 2 to 5 next window will be 3 to 6 next window will be 4 to 7. Will there be any window after 4 to 7? You can say no. Why? Because in the window 3 to 6 it is ending at 6 when it comes to 4 to 7 window of 4 size it will end at 7 but if you will start a window from 5th index you have to end it at 8th index so that it should be of 4 length but there is no 8th index present in the array of 8 size. So the last window will be from 4 till 7 only and what is this 4? This 4 is nothing but n-k as you can see 8-4 so go till the n-kth index only or if you talk about the last index go till n-1th index the window will have two indices the starting index and the ending index. Starting index will go till n-k ending index will go till n-1 the last window so just keep on shifting the window in the previous window add the element which is getting inserted remove the element which is getting removed and find out the maximum of all those windows sum. So let's now. do a try run quickly and then we will also write the instruction manual. So initially what we will say is since the subarray at least one subarray we should have in the sum variable initially sum will be 0 and we will just have a sum of the starting k element. So I will run a loop on the starting k elements and I will take the sum 0 plus 20 plus 10 plus 80 plus 50. So this sum will come out to be 30 plus 50 which is nothing but 80 plus 80 will be 160 and also obviously the maximum will also come out to be 180 the first subarray you can consider it as a maximum subarray also the maximum is 160 only not 180 but 160. Next window while going to the next window what you have to do we have to shift it that is this window will get shifted hence the element 20 will get removed the element 60 will get inserted. So in the last window what we have to do subtract 20 and add 60 so if I am taking the last index as id. IDX the element present at IDX-4 IDX-K is getting removed IDX-K 4-4 and the element at index is getting inserted. So just add the value of nums of IDX and remove the value of nums of IDX-K. This is going to be the strategy in the previous sum and keep on doing this till the last window. So what is the current sum? The current sum will be 160-20, 140, 140 plus 60 will be 200, so obviously 200 is the maximum. I might be having some problems while doing the mathematics, so even if there is any mistake in mathematics, just pardon me. Next window should be from 2 to 5, that is from the previous window having sum 200, subtract the value 10 which is getting removed nums of I-K and add the value of nums of I which is I guess 30 here. So this value will come out to be how much? 220, so it is even better. Update the maximum also. 220 keep on doing it in the next window. We will again shift the window by one size. We will say next window is having the elements 50 60 30 40. So 50 60 30 is already in the answer to some 200 all the 200 also contain 80. It does not include 40 the first exclude in the sum 220 exclude the sum 50 actually exclude 18 or 50 and include the element 40. So what will be the new sum the new sum will come out to be 220 minus 40, which is 180 when it is not the maximum. Finally, we will go to the last window in the last window in the previous sum was 180. We will subtract 50 and we will add 70. So overall what we are going to do subtract 50 and add 70. It means overall at 20. So 200 is a new sum but that is not the maximum. So finally maximum will remain 220 that was I think this particular summary or somewhere around this only. So you will return the max that is a strategy and as you can see we are just simply running a loop over there entire array only once so it is only linear in nature so started from n cube we went till linear solution by using a static sliding window technique why static because window size is fixed the sub-array size is always going to be 4k now let's write the code using this approach first of all find the sum of the first sub-array so create a variable set a integer sum as 0 and then run a loop run a for loop over all indices from 0 to k minus 1 that is starting k elements at least one sub-array should be there otherwise the sum will come out to be minus infinity just take the sum of all the element in that sub-array so add the array add index in the sum variable now whatever the sum of the first sub-array is just take it that the answer the first subarray was 20 plus 10 plus 80 plus 50 that is what we initially assumed as the maximum also so assume or set an integer max as the sum as a current sum but now start a loop from the next index that is starting subarray will be fixed but from next subarray we have to run the loop from fourth index we have to run the loop from kth index because we have already run the loop till k minus 1 so now we will start with k and we will go till the last index every time include element exclude one element include nums of i exclude nums of i minus k and so on so what we are going to do is run a for loop although these are not nested loop these are one after another so run a for loop over all indices k to n minus 1 that is starting from the same point not starting again from zero and add the array at index. the sum but also subtract one value and what do we need to subtract remove or subtract you can say not remove but subtract array at index minus K value that is element which is going outside the window from the sum whatever the new sum will be just take the maximum if it is the maximum update the maximum if the sum is greater than is greater than max update max as some finally when we are able to find all the subarrays we are able to run the sliding window we will return the maximum sum and that is what we need to do now provided that you know the approach let's just directly jump on to writing the code in Java programming language so first of all we have to find the subarray of the we have to find the sum of the first subarray of the first k elements so for that we are going to initialize the sum variable and we are going to find the sum of the starting k elements that is run a loop to attain from 0 going till the kth index actually k-1th index because starting k elements will be from 0 to k-1 and add all of these values in sum that is array of index will get added in the sum whatever the sum is just make that as the maximum because at least one subarray should be there of size k and we can assume that all itself has the answer for now let's just not run the second loop let's just return the max because let's just see whether the first loop is working fine or not because in the sample test case you will get 300 according to the current code let's see if it is going to give me 300 not the correct output but it should give me 300 yeah so it is working fine the first loop now let's run the second loop where we are actually going to do a sliding window technique where we are going to run the loop starting from where we left that is starting from kth index going till last index n-1th index and what we need to do this time is add the value same as we did We will add the area of index but also remove one value which is remove the value array of index minus k the index minus 4 if k is 4 the element which is coming out of the window and whatever the new sum is check whether is the new maximum whether it is more than the max or not. So if this sum is more than the maximum just update the max as the current sum that is what it is written also and if we will run it now hopefully it should give me 200 plus 300 500 no 300 plus 400 700 yes so it is the maximum there is some problem with the semicolon so semicolon at line number 32 we might have missed let's run it again hopefully it should be correct now okay actually it is giving me only 300 not 700 let's see why we are running the loop from k we are going till n minus 1 we are adding all the values we are subtracting not subtracting we have. to subtract we have to do minus equal to we were just writing some equal to you are assigning the value. So let's run it again small small mistakes happening and as you can see it is correct now let's submit it and see if it is going to pass all the corner cases also actually there will be one corner case only possible that what if there is no subarray of size k what if the n is itself less than k what if the array is of 3 size but the subarray we need is of 4 size in that case it is nothing mentioned what do we do in the question so we are assuming that it should never happen and as you can also see k will be less than equal to n so actually in the constraint it is mentioned that it will never happen that subarray size is given more than the array size and obviously subarray should at least have one element so we can assume there will be at least one subarray such which is possible so given that we are able to do the milestone 4 and 5 we will meet in a new video. video with a new problem till then bye bye take care"

Whenever you are solving any problem, you might have encountered into some logical issues, right? Everyone would have encountered it for sure. Pause the video and try to think through it. Just do a retrospection and how did you solve that issue? Just pause the video and think through it. Yes, so the very first instant would be to ask the instructor. Just once you will get any issue, just quickly ask the instructor and get it resolved. Second would be you will raise helpdesk ticket and try to get it resolved. Third would be you will just check with your peers quickly and try to get it resolved. Fourth one would be you will Google, try to figure it out by your own, go through the exact error message and solve it. By these mechanism only we will try to solve it. to our solve our problem, right? See, we all are programmers being a programmer. It will be part of your day-to-day activity. Believe me 70% of your time will go in debugging the issues itself. Let it be any production issue or let it be the issue in your local computer. Your 70% of time will be dedicated for debugging and 30% will be actual coding. Do you expect that someone someone in your office will help you out with debugging your program over here? You seek out for help from instructor or peers or helpless ticket but incorporate environment. Is someone going to sit with you and solve your bugs? No, it will be your task to solve it. So always before you seek out for help try to resolve it by your own only if you are not able to solve it then seek out for help. Whenever you see any issues right or error identify the test case which are failing for the given input do a dry run of the code and see why that particular test case has failed. And you can also add print statements. Add print statements for your help so that you will get some reference, OK, what was the value printed and what did you expect out of the dry run? And the last would be to take help from Q&A session and the lead mentors. That's how you should try to approach a problem. Don't always seek out for help in the first place. Try to solve it by your own. That has to be the mantra. You should solve it first by your own. If only if you are not able to solve, then seek out for help. Yeah, that's all related to debugging.

        "transcription": "Hi everyone, welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem find the maximum profit by buying and selling stocks optimally so a very large problem name a very large problem statement also but we will try to reduce the complexity of the problem we are given a array in which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day I it means we are given some prices of a given stock on some different days we can assume it is given in a array and given the array which is having all the prices of given different different days what you have to do is you have to design an algorithm to find the maximum profit by buying a share on one day and selling it on another day we have to sell a share and buy it buy sell buy sell we have to do this procedure for some number of times to find out the maximum profit which we can figure out you may repeat this process across the days that is you can buy one stock sell it and then again do it for multiple number of times but a very very important note is you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time although we can do infinite transactions as many transactions as we want but multiple transactions can't be taken at the same time it means you must sell the stock before buying again so if i am saying you if i am giving you a array let's say not array but let's say i am saying you are buying a stock on some day then what is the next possible thing which you can do can you sell it of course we can sell a stock which we have bought but can we buy another stock no this is not possible we can't have two different stocks or a given stock with two different prices to be bought together if we are buying a stock we have to sell it and then after selling it we can again buy the stock on some other day and then again sell it so this buy sell buy sell can happen as many number of times as you want but we can't just buy two times and then sell two times this is not possible so given that we are allowed to have infinite transactions what is the maximum profit which we can make let's take the sample input the number of days are given as six that is the array size is six the values of the prices of given days will be seven at the first day then one then five then three then six then four so if i draw a kind of chart so first we have a price seven then we have a price one then we have a price five then we have a price three then we have a price six and then we have a price four so these are the different prices of a given stock and the question is what is the maximum profit which we can make see if obviously i am going to buy a stock at seven price we can't sell it because first we have to buy it and then of course we can sell it first buy should happen then sell if we are buying at seven we can't sell it at a higher price obviously profit will only be made if the stock is bought on a price which is lower than the selling price but for seven there is no selling price what about one if we buy the stock at one can we sell it to a day on a day where the stock price is five yes so this is the first transaction which we are going to make buy at one sell at five next if we are buying at five obviously selling at six will give you one profit buy five sell at six one profit will be there six minus five but better will be to buy at three so that now if we will sell it at six the profit will be plus three not just plus one so here the profit was plus four here the profit was plus three and of course if we are going to buy it at six we can't sell it because after six there is no profit day so the total amount of profit which you can make it is the first transaction having profit for second transaction having profit three total profit will be four plus three which is seven and that is also given in the explanation buy on the day two then sell on the day three then buy on the day four then sell on the day five and total profit will be five minus one four plus six minus three which is three total profit will be three plus four which is seven so given this kind of array we have to find the maximum profit let's take another test case which i have already drawn actually this is a bigger array having almost you can say 13 days and on each day some price is given like one on day one three on day two two on day three and so on and as a we have to figure out what is the maximum profit which we can figure out the point is either we can explore all the choices possible that is try to buy on this day then sell on other day then buy on this day sell on another day and so on but this will actually take a lot of time because we have to ensure that we are not buying a stock twice so better will be just going a systematic manner just going a sequential manner that is try to figure out if i am buying a stock at the current day or if i am selling a stock at the current day should i buy it on the previous day or not as simple as that why because if i am just comparing adjacents if i am climbing up the hill that is if i am buying on a smaller day on a day with a smaller price and selling it on a next day with higher price i am going to make profit and why not i should take the global peak why not i should say that directly buy on day one and let's say in this example sell on day five why should not do a single transaction d1 d5 why we should do all these three transactions first d1 to d2 then d3 to d4 and then d5 to d4 to d5 the reason is if we will just do a single transaction between day one and day five the profit which you will make will be seven minus one which will be nothing but six only but what about these three blue transactions if we talk about these three transactions it will be three minus one two profit four minus two again two profit seven minus four we can say three profit total profit will be two plus two plus three which is we can say four plus three seven so seven profit versus six profit obviously seven profit is better same here for the second hill instead of directly just buying on nine and then selling out at eleven or twelve the profit will be the day 12 having price 7 minus day 9 having price 0 so 12 minus actually 7 minus 0 will be 7 only instead of having just a single transaction better will be to do two transactions first transaction day 9 comma day 10 that is 4 comma 0 so 4 minus 0 for profit then this transaction having 7 minus 3 which is nothing but 3 profit total profit will be again be 4 plus 3 actually have we done something wrong this is 7 and this is 3 so 7 minus 3 7 minus 3 not 4 7 minus 3 is 4 4 plus 4 will be 8 so total profit will be 8 more than 7 that is having just immediate transactions just immediate days we are buying on day 1 selling on day 2 buying on day 3 selling on day 4 buying on day 4 selling on day 5 will be better than waiting for a bigger price a day why because we are now capitalizing over these downhills that is if we are taking this 2 we are again they taking this 2 and the portion is common the height one is common in these two things so we are again able to take hike we are again able to take the profit by doing multiple transactions instead of just doing single transaction and should we take the transaction between d5 d6 also between d6 d7 also between d7 d8 no if we are having a price drop or if we are having a same price we should not take it from going to d7 to d8 the price will remain same so 2 minus 2 will be 0 only no profit if we are going to take a transaction by buying on day 6 selling on day 7 it will be actually 2 minus 6 minus 4 profit or you can say 4 loss why we should take loss we should not take loss so we will only take those transactions where the current day price is more than the previous day price day 5 was having price more than day 4 day 4 more than day 3 day 2 more than day 1 we should not take transaction between day 2 and day 3 so adjacents can be compared and if we are getting a hike we will add it in the total profit and we will just return that total profit so in this case what will be the total profit three minus one two plus this profit four minus two two again plus this one the profit is three next these are negative so don't take them these are negative so zero don't take them but take this profit four take this profit four and finally last profit is negative so don't take it so total profit we can say will be seven plus eight which is nothing but 15 15 will be the total profit if i am not wrong in the calculations but logic is pretty simple let's just do what let's go to the portal and write the instruction manual what we are going to do we are going to set a variable which is total profit set a integer variable profit initially to zero because initially profit will be zero now compare the adjacent by comparing i with i plus one so run a for loop run a for loop over indices i from 0 till last index till prices dot length till the last index till last index but what we have to do if we are comparing i with i plus 1 both i as well as i plus 1 should exist and when the i will be the last index in this case when it will be day 13 next day does not exist so in such a case if you will just run the loop till last index and you will get i plus 1 it will give you index out of bound error or exception something so just make sure you are not running the loop till the n minus 1th index you are only running the loop till n minus 2th index so i will run from 0 to n minus 2 where i am just writing where n is equal to the array length the prices arrays length prices array length every time what we have to do we have to check if the current day price is less than the next day price or you can say next day price is more than the current day price so if prices at i plus one day is more than price at ith day what we have to do if the price at the next day is more just take the profit so we will say add the difference in prices at i plus one and price at i in the profit variable just add the difference that is add three minus one add four minus two and so on add the difference between the prices in the profit variable and when the entire for loop is done we can just return the profit variable that is the maximum profit which we can make given that we are allowed infinite transactions such that no two transactions should take place simultaneously multiple transactions should be taken but at one time only one transaction should be there so this will be the pseudocode what will be the time and space complexity as you can see that we have to run a loop over the input array a single loop will be there running a loop over all the days it will be order of n time complexity where n is the number of days that is array size and space complexity since we do not require any extra space space complexity will be constant we are just having a variable profit and that will be four bytes usually we will be writing the code for the problem so we are creating a profit variable initially which is set to zero I am writing the code in Java programming language for now we have to run a for loop starting from index 0 we have to start the loop from index 0 and go till the second last index that is index will run till it will run till less than prices dot length minus one that is till less than equal to n minus 2 and index plus plus every time what we need to do we need to check if the current day price is smaller than next day price or next day price is greater than current day price so if prices of i plus one is more than greater than prices of i it means we are going to uphill uphill means we have to take the profit so how we can take the profit we can just add the current transaction that is prices of i plus 1 minus prices of i plus 1 minus prices of i in the total profit variable and finally we can return profit the code is pretty simple but for now just to show you all the transactions which we are doing let's just print the transactions so i am printing the transactions by printing the buy day and then the selling day so i am having arrow where i am saying first i am writing the buy day that is the buy price on ith day and then selling price on the i plus 1th day let's check the array which we have taken in the sample video where we were having actually 13 days and the all the days let's just write the values so it was 1 3 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 12 13 12 13 12 4 7 1 3 2 4 7 1 3 2 4 7 let's just after having 7 have 6 then there is 2 then again 2 so 6 2 2 then finally 0 6 2 2 0 and then let's do it for the remaining days that is having price 4 3 7 6 4 3 7 6 so let's write 4 3 7 6 so hopefully the input I am giving is the same input which we have done the dry run on let's see if it is going to give me 15 output or not if the dry run which we were doing was correct if the calculations were correct it should give me 15 output but there is a some problem hope most probably with the code itself it is going in index out of bound somewhere or some other issue there is a profit variable initially we are running a loop over all the indices starting from 0 going till prices dot length minus 2 that is less than prices dot length minus 1 and if next index price is more than the current index price what we are checking we are saying that just add the difference of the prices in the profit variable and once it is done we are also printing it and finally we are returning the profit. Let's run it again to see if it is now running or not like we have not done any changes but it might be a platform issue or a portal issue somewhere maybe let's remove this input there might be some problem in the input itself let's run it without giving a sample input so we can say that there is a variable prices which it cannot find or actually if condition it cannot find so there is some problem with the curly brackets if we are having this curly bracket the variable i is not declared okay so variable i is not declared so we can run the loop over index instead of idx having let's say i only if i will run it again let's see if it is working fine or not for the sample test case which they were giving me it should give me seven for the test case which they have provided and it is actually uh like taking for a different test case at the output it is giving me is four and all the transactions it is also getting printed but let's just take the sample test case which we had done a run on that is having 13 days the bar chart which we drawn so it is taking some time to run hopefully it should give me all the transactions as you can see the output is 15 that is the total final profit is same transactions are from 1 to 3 2 to 4 4 to 7 then from 0 to 4 and then 3 to 7 so all the transactions are same as discussed let's just remove this print line which we have done for the debugging although there was no error in the code but if i will run it now It should give me accepted for the sample dash case and let's wait for it and if I will submit it, it will work for hopefully all the dash cases. Let's see. It is taking some time to run and as you can see all the dash cases, corner cases are getting passed. What is the time complexity? As you can see, there is a loop running on the array of n size. The total time complexity will be linear and the space complexity, since we are not taking any extra space, we are not creating any array or any other data structure. Space complexity will be constant, that is order of one. So with that, we are done with the problem. Find the maximum profit by buying and selling stocks optimally."

After my graduation, by the time of COVID problem, so since because of that, there was a lack of placement cell. Then I decided to switch to the domain for software development. So I was searching on YouTube to learn the skills and I tried to learn, but there was no structured curriculum. By the time I came across Cryo, I felt the curriculum was really good, well structured, as well as those projects were really good. Then I joined Cryo and I learned everything from scratch. In Cryo, I took the fellowship in full stack specialization, where I learned the Mern stack, in which they taught me for the front-end HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, and for the back-end Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as well. Apart from this, they also taught me DSA, which will be very helpful for tracking the interviews, as well as which also... improves my problem solving skills. In Cryo, everything was practical. They did learn by doing, by which I was able to learn, and also I was practically doing everything. The instructors were really professional. The way how they approach the problem, the way how they code was really good. At the end of my program, the recession starts, but I was so confident that I have my skills and also I have a really good project. So recruiters were also very impressive about my profile and I was sincerely getting shortlisted. If you need some well-structured curriculum or if you need to crack the interviews with the help of a DAC, if you need to, how to approach a problem, if you really need a good mentorship, then Cryo is the best."

        "transcription": "Hi everyone welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem reverse the bits of a given integer reverse the bits of a given 32 bit unsigned integer number of bits in the integer will be 32 although you might be given a 64 bit integer as a parameter but you have to consider only 32 bits from the right hand side the last 32 bits that is from 0th index till 31st index bit and the number which will be given to you will be unsigned integer it means the number will be positive integer you will not be given a negative integer and you don't need to figure out or you don't need to basically worry about the overflow because you only have to figure out the reversing of 32 bits out of 64 input will be a 64 bit number so there will be no such scenario where overflow is occurring so let's Let's actually do what let's actually take a number which they are giving you is a very long string. Although just doing the dry run or just thinking the problem in terms of 32 bits will be very difficult. Let's do what let's just for now focus on a number which is of 8 bits. I am taking a number which is 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 how many bits are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 bits are there after reversing 8 bits obviously there will be zeros in the left. You can append as many zeros in the left same as a number is 932. You can append as many zeros. It will remain same in integer same thing for bits. You can append as many 0 bits in the left, but after reversing it what will happen? Obviously these bits will go at the 31st index 30 as 30th index and so on but I am just showing you in 8 bits. So in 8 bits representation this bit will go at the 7th index. This is 0. index first index, always bits are numbered from the right most bit. Second Index, Third Index, Fourth Index, Fifth Index, Sixth Index, Seventh Index, so what will happen is, The 0th Index bit will go at the 7th Index, the 1st Index bit will go at the 6th Index, 2nd Index bit will go at the 5th index, the 3rd Index bit will go at the 4th index, the 4th Index bit will go at the 3rd index then 5th index will go at the 2nd Index then 6th Index will go at the 1st Index and finally 0th Index will go at the, 7th Index will go at the 0th Index, so this is what the output will be looking like after swapping, so output will obviously be of the same number of bits, if input is 32 bits, output will also be 32 bits, if input is 8 bits, output will also be 8 bits, but the point is how to reverse the order of bits, see when we used to reverse an array, when we used to reverse a string, what logic we used to apply, we usually tried to implement it using two pointer technique. So here also, what we can do is we can apply two pointer and using that two pointer, we will be able to reverse, but in array or in string, we used to apply two pointers on the indices of the array or indices of the characters. Let's say there was an array 10, 20, 30, 40. So what we will do, we will apply a left pointer on zero index, a right pointer at the last index and minus one at index swap left with right. This will become 40. This will become 10. Left, plus, plus right. Minus, minus swap the left element with the right element. This will become 30. This will become 40 left. Plus, plus right. Minus, minus, as soon as left is more than right, we should stop. That is entire array reverse. This was an array. Same for string also. Same logic. We will apply for the numbers, but a single number bits needs to be reversed. So two pointer will be on bits. One pointer on the zeroth bit, let's say this is the pointer number one. You can't say left or right because actually this will be right or even if you want to say this is right bit the right most bit the 0th bit and this will be the left most bit which is 7 in our example although it will be 31 in actual because the number is given as 32 bit integer so last bit will be 31 starting from 0 till 31 32 bits are there but for now let's just take 7th bit. Initially what we can assume is output is empty empty means all the bits are 0 none of the bits are set so if none of the bits are set all the bits are 0 so initialize the answer the output which we need to return as 0 start with the number first of all we are having the left bit 0 the right bit also 0 so if left is also 0 right is also 0 no need to do anything in the output they are already 0s so if left is 0 output at the right will remain 0 if right is 0 in input output at right will remain 0 let me just remove this thing. This arrow which we are using for reverse. I know you you already know that we have to reverse now. I think problem statement is at least clear. We are discussing second milestone which is the problem approach. So we have to reverse it. What we are saying initially is in order to reverse the 0th bit with the 7th bit, no need to do anything because both the bits are already 0. So they will remain 0. Left will become actually minus minus. This is what I was instead of using left and right. Maybe what you can do is you can use some other variable names for these two pointers. Left will become minus minus. That is from 7 to 6. Right will become plus plus from 0 to 1. Again, compare the bits. The 6th bit that is the left bit is a set. It is 1. So in the output also, but at the 6th index no in the output at the right index, I will make it set. Since that is not set in the output, I will make let it remain not set. That is swapping the 6th index with the 1st index and 1st index with the 6th index. I will make this bit set in the output. I will let this bit remain same that is 0 in the output. Make the left bit go to the right, make the right bit go to the left left will become minus minus right will become plus plus now again 1 and 1 both sides are 1 so left will make the right bit in the output become 1 right will make the left bit in the output become 1 that is 5th index will make the 2nd index become 1 in the output 2nd index will become 5th index become 1 in the output left minus minus right plus plus this is 0 so in the output the right bit will remain 0 since right bit is 1 in the output left will bit left bit will become 1 and as soon as you will do left plus plus and you will do right minus minus left crosses right we are able to reverse the entire bits or you can say we are able to reverse the number in terms of bits. is the final output which we will return now in this logic two important points which we discussed one thing is while we were checking whether the element the bit at the right index or at the right left index is it zero or one so one function which we need to implement is check whether the bit is set or not check set bit at a given index in a given number at a given bit index we need to check whether a bit is set or not it will either give me true or it will give me false and the other function is if we need to set a bit in the output we will call a function set bit which will in the n number update the bit at the bit index to be true or to be one and return the new number after setting it and the point how will we implement these two functions that you can maybe go through on your own or that you may may go through the through the previous questions regarding we are just quickly going to revise these two functions check set bit and set bit number if let's say I want to I have this number 0 1 0 1 0 0 and I need to check whether the bit present at the second index is a set or not what we can do is we can create a mask such that all the other bits are 0 only the second bit is 1 and how will I create this mask that mask can be created using 1 left shift left shift B if this B is 2 1 left shift left shift 2 once the mask is created how you can check whether that bit is set in the input number n or not you can just do the n and mask if you will do n and mask what it will give you 0 and 0 0 1 and 0 0 0 and 0 0 1 and 1 will give you 1 then all the zeros so if the output number after n and mask you are getting is non-zero it means that bit was set and if you will get a 0 value it means that bit was not set maybe I can give you a quick example for that where the bit is not set. Let's take the same number, but this time let's try to check for the third index bit. It is not set. I will create a mask where all the bits are unset except the third bit, which is going to be set. This is the mask. One left shift, left shift 3. One left shift, left shift 3 is the number. And now do the mask with n. You will get the number 0 and 0, 0, 1 and 0, 0, 0 and 1, 0, 1 and 0, 0, 0, 0. So in the output, as you can see all the numbers, all the bits will be 0. So it is equal to 0. It means that it was not set. So here return true because number is not equal to 0. Here return false because output n and mask is equal to 0. This is to only check whether the bit is set first function, but how to set a corresponding bit. If a bit is already set, then no need to worry, but how to set a bit which is unset right now. Maybe if I take the number, same number again, and if I try to set the third bit, how to set the third bit. create the same mask that is 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 left shift left shift 3 create the same thing mask is same but now to set it instead of doing and you have to do or operator n or mask if you will do or all the other bits will remain same as in the input 0 1 1 0 0 only the bit which you need to set that will become one if it is not one already it will become one if it is already one it will remain same so this is how you will do the setting of a corresponding bit by doing or with mask checking was with and with mask setting is to or with mask so now that you are good with the all the approach and the concept also we are going to go with the instruction manual so what we will do is we will maintain two pointers we will say set left as the zeroth index actually right as a zeroth index because the zeroth index will be the rightmost bit so set right as 0 and left as the 31st bit first bit if the numbers the number of bits are 32 so it will be only till 31 because counting is starting from zero run the loop till the pointers are crossing are not crossing so run a while loop only till what tell right pointer this pointer towards basically towards the right it crosses left you can say right if it becomes smaller than left then stop or left if it becomes greater than right then stop so we have to run the loop only till the left pointer is a smaller than right pointer or even if it is equal you can run the loop it is your wish you can write left less than equal to right run the loop till that point or less than equal to right both are correct i am just using less left less than right left less than right what we will do is we will check the bit at the left index if it is set or not and first of all we have to create the answer variable also so set the answer as zero initially it will have all the 0 and what we need to do is now check the bit in n is a set check the left bit is a set in n or not if it is set if yes then set the right bit in answer if the left bit is set in input set the right bit in output and same for vice versa. That is if check first of all right bit in n is a set then what we need to do we need to basically say that if yes then set the left bit left will become right right will become left that is what reversing is two-pointer technique and once we are able to do it for all the bits one by one we will also do left become minus minus right become plus plus that is we will say that left is going from left is going from 0 1 2 3 right is going from 7 6 5 4 and so on so actually the 2. pointers will not stop when left is greater than right right now they will continue when left becomes smaller than right then you have to stop because left is coming from the right hand side this left pointer so I hope I am correct maybe what we are saying is initially right was the 7th index left was 0th index right was left was we are saying left is 31 ok no if this is left if we are saying left is 7 or 31 whatever so I have left with right left minus minus right plus plus left minus minus right plus plus left minus minus right plus plus left minus minus right plus plus left minus minus right plus plus and if left becomes more than right stop if left becomes more than right stop that is another loop till left smaller than right yes it everything is correct I was confused a little bit. Anyways this logic is correct the only thing which you need to do is implement the functions checking whether a bit is set, setting whether, setting a corresponding bit. So I will have a function to. check a bit which will return true or false check set bit which will take the number and which will take the bit which you need to check in that what we need to do first create a mask create a mask as one left shift left shift bit first make the bit one go towards that position which we need to check and now to check do them n and bit n and mask we will do the and operation if n and mask this value is giving you zero then the bit is not set then return false otherwise if it is giving you non-zero then the bit is set so return true this is how to check a bit is set or not but we also have to implement the set bit function which will set a bit so setting bit will update the number and we will return the updated number which will take the number which need to set in and the bit which we need to set so for that again create the same mask in the previous check function but this time instead of doing n and mask we will do n or mask and return the new number that is we will say return the n or mask whatever the new number is return that so that we can update in the main function. So this is the entire instruction manual for the problem reverse the bits of a given integer and what is the time complexity of this approach going to be since a number of value n can have log base to n number of bits although in this question they are only 32 bits so either you can say that time complexity will be n log base to n where n is the number input number or you can say since question also says that only 32 bits are there and can be at max 2 raised to power 31 so in that case the time complexity can also be said like constant so both are equivalent log base to n or constant because n is very small or even though n is large. log n will be very small almost equivalent to constant. What about the space complexity space will not be extra as such because we are just creating an answer variable which is also a 32 bit integer or 64 bit integer something like that. So constant space constant time solution or constant space logarithmic time solution you can say any solution any time complexity both will be correct. We will be writing the code in Java programming language. So first we need to do what we need to apply a two pointer technique on bits. So one pointer will be at 0th index because the rightmost bit is 0th index. So right will be starting from 0 and left will be starting from the highest bit the most significant bit the rightmost bit which is 31 and we will say answer is a long variable because we have to return a 64 bit integer answer although it will be initially empty 0. What we need to do is we need to apply the two pointer. is smaller than or equal to right or only smaller than right every time check the left bit check the right bit using the check bit function we will apply the check set bit function in the number check the left bit is set or not if it is set do something similarly for right if it is set we will do something we don't need to swap directly although we are saying that we in reversal logic we have to swap but instead of swap we are using the concept of check bit set bit so if the left bit is set in the input number n we will update the right bit in the output by making it set so answer will get updated by setting the bit in the answer variable at the right index not at the left index and what about the right index if it is set in the input number n answer we will set at the left index it is left set in input right set in output right set in input left set in output vice versa and after basically setting them we also have to do what we also have to basically do the left pointer plus plus right pointer minus minus actually left minus minus right plus plus it is a different kind of two pointer where left is going from zero towards the bigger value right is going from 31 towards the smaller value actually i said actually inverse left is going from bigger value to smaller 31 to 0 right is going from 0 till bigger value so right plus plus once the entire two pointer is done we will return the answer that is what we have to do although it was not written in the instruction manual but that is self-explanatory that we have to return it we have to print it or return it whatever the only thing remaining is how to check a bit and how to set a bit so to check a bit or set a bit first we have to create a mask how to create a mask we have to do the left shift on the number one bit number of times whatever bit we need to check one set so first create a mask as one left shift left shift bit. However, since we need a long variable, we need to check in a long 64 bit integer. This one should also be in long. There are two ways. Either you can write long like this in front of it or you can also one right one L L means long you are writing L to make the number digit one become long one. Now check if the bit is set by doing and and mask that we have already discussed in the approach. So if n and mask is going to give you zero, it means that bit is not set return false. However, if it is going to give you zero return true, it is set. So this is to check a bit similar way. We will set a bit. The only thing is instead of doing and we will do or with n n or mask this n actually will not be the same and as the reverse bit function. It will be the answer because we are passing answer here. So one small mistake found you have to pass answer not n because we have to set the bit in answer. When we are checking in the input left bit is set answers right bit will be set if inputs left right bit is set answers left bit will be set. So let's now run the code and see if it is going to work fine or not. Hopefully it should be but let's see. It is going to take some time. So it is showing some error. We can't find the symbol answer. It is due to some weird error. Actually, we have to call the set bit function. Why I am calling a function named as answer. I'm not sure why typo big typo, but hopefully it should give me the correct answer now. Okay. No, so for a number 4 3 2 6 1 5 9 6 it is expected that it should give me this particular number. However, it is giving me 0 so it means in the output. None of the bits are getting set. This logic is not at all working and why it is not working. The reason is. is a small error which we have done actually in the condition left should it be smaller than right no left till the point it is greater than right so again a point of confusion because left is starting from 31 or 7 the bigger index right is starting from smaller index so instead of left smaller than right we have to write the condition as left should be greater than right then only two pointer will run how i am able to get the point that the two pointer is not running because answer is remaining zero it means this loop is not running so instead of less than symbol we have to use greater than symbol here let's run it again and see again it is taking some time and as you can see it is working fine now let's submit it and see if it is going to pass all the test cases this is a older summation it is right now doing the summation the new one so as soon as it is getting accepted for new one it will show up let's wait for few seconds you can see now it is getting accepted for the new test case actually the new code the current code so code is all the very large due to the instruction manual and due to separate functions for check bit set bit although there are inbuilt functions also available in java to check a bit is set or not and set it also but we are not using inbuilt ones because you should know the concept of masking you should know the concept of checking setting unsetting all of these what is the time complexity it will be logarithmic of n where n is the number which you need to reverse the bits of or you can say it is constant because number of bits given in the question are only 32 this loop will only run for 32 times both of these operations are constant operations or logarithmic operations but still since log n of log 32 you can say 2 to the power 32 will be only 32 it will be order of 32 which is almost constant so a constant time constant space solution with that we are done with the problem reverse bits of a given number We will meet in a new video with a new problem."

        "transcription": "After graduating, I was working on a project which was not into development. Around 7 or 8 months, I kind of lost my touch to programming. In between, I left everything. Things were not moving as I thought. Things were not going on as per my plan. I am Rohit Yadav. I graduated from B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering. So, to upskill myself, I joined Cryo.do. Cryo, I felt, had more demanding projects. So, I really like the approach of you understand the problem and then try some common approaches. Then, you try the way how an actual developer needs to solve that problem. I never thought of writing clean code and patterns which you should follow or a great programmer has to follow. Prior to this, I always used to like, okay, let's solve the problem as quickly as possible. So, there was a Geek Trust challenge. After solving that challenge, I feel, okay, when you have solved the problem, that is not where your job is done. Your job is done when you have written a very clean code which is understandable by other people as well. And it is extendable and maintainable. do remember there was a advanced binary search problem on which for days I was stuck. I put a ticket and I got like within one or two hours, I got one meeting link and instructor didn't told me the answer exact answer. He showed me the path how you should be approaching it. I was not spoon fed the answer at midnight around 12 or 1 something strike to me and I was like, okay, let's try it and I tried on the cryo DSA platform and it worked. So I still remember how to solve it or I still remember in and ins and outs about the advanced binary search. In between, I left everything things were not moving as I thought things were not going on as per my plan. I had designed for my job. So in that phase, I used to regularly get a call from like success manager and like mentors and they used to constantly push me on WhatsApp or on call messages like Rohit, things will improve all these. like hiring freezes and layoffs are just temporary, you can still do it. All those pushes I used to get from mentors. So that's really a great feeling. One advice I would give is don't put so much pressure on yourself. Even if you are moving slowly, at least you are moving. Don't put a brake and trust the process. You will reach the point where you thought of reaching. And I'm really thankful to Cryo.io."

        "transcription": "Hello everyone. Welcome back in this particular video, we will be discussing the problem, find local peak, right? Uh, program to find the peaks in a given sequence. Now, what does a peak, you can say peak is nothing but a given element, which is maximum, maximum kind of manner. The condition or the criteria when a element is said to be peak is defined. Now element is a peak element. If it is greater than its neighbors, who are the neighbors, the element to the left of it, the element to the right of it, that is a of I will be considered a peak if a of I is more than a of I minus one, that is a previous index element. As well as, and operator as well as it should be greater than area of I plus one. And as you can see, it is strictly greater condition. It is not like if the left neighbor is equal to the current node, then also it is a peak. No, it should be strictly greater than both. neighbors, then only it will be considered a peak. But there are certain corner scenarios, which you have to figure out, which is actually given in the question itself. What is given for the leftmost element that is the array zero index. Can you say that there is any left neighbor? No, there is no left neighbor in that scenario. So in that scenario, you only have to check to the right of it. That is array of zero will be checked only with area of one. If it is greater than area of one, then yes, you can consider area of zero as a peak element. We will also take some examples to understand this. Similarly, for the rightmost element, that is the arrays last index. What we can assume is that we only have to check with the left neighbor of it, because the right neighbor will not exist. There will not be any element after the last index and minus one. So in that case, area of N minus one should only be greater than area of N minus two, then it will be considered a peak element. So these two are some corner cases, which we have to think and then only code particularly. So the example which they have given is arrays containing 10, 5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 15. Let's just quickly write the indices for them. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Obviously, indexing starts from 0 in all the languages. And which elements will be considered peak? Let's first think about the corner scenarios. Will the 0th index, the leftmost element, will it be considered a peak? There is no left neighbor, so don't compare it with it. There is a right neighbor which is smaller than 10. 5 is smaller than 10. Yes, 10 will be considered a peak. If you will draw it in the form of a graph, then 10 will be something like this. Then there will be a 5 value. And obviously, if there is nothing in the left, you can assume there is minus infinity in the left. That is, nothing means as minimum as possible. So you can see 10 is a peak. Now going from 5 to 6, you can say that 5 is not a peak because 5 is actually less than both the neighbors. However, it should be greater than both the neighbors. just inverse of peak which is actually known as valley which is also a follow-up problem if you want to calculate or find out all the valleys then in that five will be counted or five will be printed what about six six is greater than the left neighbor that is five but what about the right neighbor right neighbor is three then yes six is also a peak ten was a peak six is a peak it is strictly greater than both the neighbors what about three of course three is not less than it is not greater than the left neighbor so it is not a peak element five is not a peak element what about four four is greater than left neighbor which is three but it is not greater than the right neighbor which is eight so four is not a peak it should be greater than strictly greater than both the neighbors right now it is only greater than three not greater than right neighbor which is eight what about it similar scenario for it it is greater than four but not greater than nine so it is also not a peak what about nine nine is greater than eight but not greater than 15 so nine is also not a peak Let's say even if this value was not 15, if this value was 9 itself, then 9 can still not be a peak. Why? Because the right neighbor cannot be equal. But right now it is 15. What about 15? There is nothing in the right side. So again, you can assume minus infinity. There is a 9 which is lesser than 15. So yes, 15 is a peak. So how many peaks are there? 10 was there, 6 was there and 15 was there. You can say there are in total 3 peak elements present and we have to print all 3 of them. We don't just have to count the peaks, we have to print all of them. And since we need to print all of them, now we are actually discussing the approach. Do we need to go to each and every element and check whether it has a peak or not? The answer is yes. If we are not going to each and every index and checking whether it is peak, how will you be able to print all the peaks? If question was maybe print only one peak out of them, then you can think of some optimization, then you can think of some divide and conquer or binary search or whatever you know. But right now, since it is just a simple. simple linear traversal approach, we are going to do a linear search kind of strategy. That is, we will be linearly iterating over the array, checking whether each index follows the criteria, follows the condition, whether it is a peak element or not. So just go to each and every index and check whether array of i is greater than array of i minus one as well as and operator or whatever the operator is in your programming language. Usually it is represented by ambersand symbol. As well as array of i should be greater than array of i plus one. But before applying this condition, if element is greater than both the neighbors strictly greater, you also have to ensure whether array of i minus one exist or not, whether array of i plus one exist or not. If not, then take the value as minus infinity. That is, instead of just directly comparing with array of i minus one, take a variable, let's say left, left neighbor, take a variable, let's say right neighbor and do what? Initialize the left with minus infinity. minus infinity or you can say the minimum value which your data type can store let's say for integer it will be the integrals minimum value and then you can compare whether area of i is greater than left neighbor as well as right neighbor if left neighbor and right neighbor does not exist let it be minus infinity so that this condition always gets true and if it is existing then update the value with area of i minus one or area of i plus one respectively so now since the approach is clear that we don't have to do anything apart from linear search we have to go to each and every index check the condition if it is true then obviously print the element because we have to print the values not the indices that is also important linear traversal that is linear time complexity or you can say order of n time complexity where n is representing the number of elements in the array and what about the space complexity see when we are traversing over the array array is given to us as an input whenever we calculate space complexity, we never include the input spaces in it. So since input is a array, which is not going to be considered as extra space, auxiliary data sector. Space will be constant. Why? Because there is no extra data sector, which we are creating in order to do linear search. Linear search is just in place of solution. So space is a constant. You can say order of one space complexity for this particular approach and the time will be linear. And the answer, whether we can optimize it further is no. Why? Because we have to print all of the peaks and that is not possible to do with that without doing linear search, or you can say with using binary search or maybe with divide and conquer. So now since there is only one approach, there is nothing much to discuss in the second milestone, which is the approach part, let's just now directly jump on to writing the instruction manual, the pseudo code. So what we have to do is we have to, let's say create a list because we have to not print the elements, but we have to return. them in by storing them in a list of peaks. So create a list of peaks of integers. Of course the list will be empty. Initially it will be empty and of course you have to make it as a dynamic array or you can say a vector in C++, a list in Java and so on. So a dynamic array should be created. Run a loop over all the indices of the array that is run a for loop from 0 till n-1. Let's say the for loop is working for index from 0 to n-1. Find out who is the left neighbor and if you are saying that left neighbor should be array of i-1 then that will be incorrect. Why? Because it might happen i-1 index does not exist. So store left neighbor left neighbor value as array of i-1 or you can say index-1 that is the value at previous index if it exists. If index-1 exists that is if it is within the range of 0 to n-1. one otherwise take it as minus infinity take otherwise take it as minus infinity i am just writing minus inf to represent minus infinity it depends in your programming language how will you define the minimum value of an integer or minimum value of your range similarly you have to store the right neighbor value in a variable right as array of index plus one but same thing that if index plus one exists then only otherwise if index plus one does not exist then you have to do what take it as minus infinity that is a minimum value then only this criteria will be fulfilled that you are only comparing with left neighbor you are not comparing with right because even if you compare with right it is minus infinity so it will always be true any value will always be greater than minus infinity same for left one now since we have taken both the variables what we can do is check if the current element is speed if element if array at index is more than the left neighbor as well as as well as the area of index is more than the right neighbor both of the neighbors are smaller. So the current element is speak and as you can see, we are checking for strictly greater than value. Then we can add the current element at the current element. You can say that is area of index in the list of peaks in the list of peaks. And finally, once this entire loop is done, what we can do is we can also return the list of peaks. All what we have to do, linear time complexity, constant space. Why? Because we never include the input space, output space. Input is an array. Output is a list. Apart from these two data sectors, there is nothing extra auxiliary. That's why constant space is there. We will be now discussing the milestone for where I will write the code, particularly in Java programming language. You have to also watch or you can say you we have to also discuss about the time and space complexity again based on the code which we will be writing. So we already have the instruction manual written for us. what we have to do it in java how to create a dynamic list that is by using list on the left hand side however if you want to make it as a list on the left hand side you can do it but since we need to return a list it is better to have a list on the left hand side that is we are creating a list but how we are creating it there are different ways of creating it there is a error list way link list way then there is a other way known as tag also but right now the easiest way is nothing but error list that is a dynamic array array which can grow in size initially it will be empty initially it will have zero elements present in it and now what we have to do is we have to run a loop over all the elements of the array that is starting from the zeroth index going till the last index which is n minus one or you can say less than n checking whether the current element is a peak or not but before checking we have to find out both the neighbors of that element so we will say who is the left neighbor left neighbor is array of index minus one but array of index minus one will not exist if index minus one is less than zero because left neighbor will not exist if index is zero index minus one will be minus one so if index is zero then in that scenario what do we have to do is we have to take the left neighbor as integer dot min value that is minus infinity in java otherwise we can take the previous index value because before getting the value of a given index you have to ensure whether the index exists or not it otherwise it will give you a index out of bound exception in java so if the previous index does not exist take it as minimum value if it exists take it so i'm using a ternary operator this is nothing but equivalent to a if else condition just the way of writing if else is replaced by a single line statement which is ternary operator that is this is the condition if the condition is true evaluate the expression after question mark and if it is not true that is false then evaluate the expression after the colon what to do for the right value right value will exist at array of index plus one instead of index minus one but again when this index will be out of index out of bound we will say when the index the current element is the last element that is the current element is the last index of the array then the next element the right neighbor will not exist so again we have to take the integer dot min value in that scenario and if it exists we can take the value as done in the previous line also now that we have both the neighbors the left neighbor the right neighbor now is the point we can surely compare whether the current element is strictly greater than the left value as well as the right value if it is then we can say the current element is a peak so in that scenario what we can do is we can just add the current element in the array of peaks let's rename this array of peaks as peaks and we will say peaks dot add the value which is array of index it's because we have to print the values not the indices and finally we can easily return the piece that is the dynamic array or you can say the arrow list let's quickly run this it is not a hard problem actually it is a very easy problem if you know linear search most probably you should be able to do this on your own also even without watching this current video which right now you are watching actually the reason is this kind of corner scenarios are a little bit you can say trickier to find out that's why we have included this problem for your practice but since you can see the sample dash case is working let's just submit also to confirm whether all the corner scenarios will work or not where the leftmost element is the peak the rightmost element is the peak and there will also be a one scenario where you have to think yourself what will happen if there is only one element in the array my code will even work if there is only one element in the array let's say the element is 10 so if there is only one element in the array there will be no left neighbor no right neighbor of course we can assume minus infinity minus infinity so of course 10 will be a peak so in that scenario also this code is correct you can say index will be 0 n minus 1 will also be 0 that is in both the scenarios take minus infinity only so don't just cram the code or don't just cram the approach try to think of the various boundary scenarios and also try to think of the time and space complexity which you can easily see is linear in terms of time because we are just running a loop over n elements of the array order of n time complexity what about space there is an input array there is an output list apart from the input and output data structures there is nothing else which we are creating and when we say space complexity we only consider the extra space the auxiliary data structures which we create and we have not created anything apart from input output to solve this problem that's why the space complexity is constant order of one so that was the last milestone for the problem with that we are done with it. We will meet in a new video with a new problem."

I never heard about a platform like Cryo. Many of the forces in the market are providing video lectures and all. So Cryo is a different thing. So we have to get all these references and then projects from the scratch. Cryo helped me to write the code, that is just scalable and professional. I actually learned many of those skills from the Cryo and actually Cryo also helped to understand the industry manner, how industries work on their projects. So Cryo projects also helped me to build my resume. Earlier at the college level, I only had one project to write in my resume and the projects are basic and not like industrial level. Cryo is not only to learn about the code. to also learn about the company's work manner, how companies are working on the project, real project. So I joined Cryo and upskilled myself.

That's why I chose software development program. Myself, Ashish Singla. Right now, I am a student at Chandigarh University. Doing a part-time internship in a tech company known as Coldell. I got offered via Cryo only. I was very interested in software development. Wanted to explore that. So I started. I can get more skills in software development if I join with Cryo. So I went with it. I explored it for myself. I joined a seminar. I like way of your teaching. Like doing things by learning rather than cramming a lot of theory in the books. Having no idea what are we even looking at. Like getting to see what we are building in real time is very good. I wanted to build things. That's why I chose software development program. Aspiration was to learn as much as I can about the software development and what actually goes on into the industry. I think the key learning was about the entire workflow of... of the development, like using Git and other tools, reading other people's code, finding out what it means developing more opponents, like that actually was a little new. I would like to say to explore more, like interact with the peers. That is one of the biggest reasons to coming to Cryonaut, rather than isolated coding, getting help as well as collaboration with other people. Also to explore as much as we can."

        "transcription": "Hey, this is Dathina, co-founder of Career.Guru. This is Career Cafe. It's amazing to see people transforming their career after a few years into whatever they're doing. But generally, career tasks are tough. It takes a lot of effort, right? So here, we want to share some of the insights about how to think about what you're doing currently, what you aspire for, how to plan your career transition. We have had a lot of questions from our audience. I'm going to pick one of the most common in the audience today and share our perspectives. Oh, this is my favorite. I'm on a maternity break, have a three, four years of break. Can I get back into IT industry? We get this question a lot, right? Due to our cultural context and the child care support ecosystem we have in the country, we have a lot of women after starting their career, working for three, four years, getting to sometimes one year, sometimes four, five years of break. especially when breaks become 4-5 years, it becomes really, really tough for them to get back into the industry. Let's take an example. The name is Ayushi. She worked with a large IT company for 5 years. She was into production support. She was doing a little bit of coding in Java. She had to take a break, a paternity break. One year went to 2 years, 2 years became 3 years. After 5 years, the kid started going to school and she started thinking, what do I do next? It's really, really frustrating. She actually thinks she has lost track of her career. We get a lot of users who have real potential, probably doing great in their careers before break. But once they get into 4-5 years of break, once they actually, first thing is they get lost in touch with their work. And technology will say what? When they talk to their colleagues and friends, they think it's too tough for them to pick up things now. After spending 4-5 years at home, they also lost touch with their learning habit. What do I do? Millions of people like Ayushi. country, we are asking what do I do next? The first thing I tell them is, yeah, you lack confidence. First of all, get in the habit of learning. Get in the habit of start doing things. There have been programs in the past. They've been doing development work or semi-development work in the past. When they want to get back into industry, the first thing they need to do is start programming. Get their foundations back. Get into building small projects. Once they get their confidence back, a lot of opportunities start opening for them. Especially for women, we have a lot of multi-industry companies. Companies like Wal-Mart, Margaret Stanley. I've seen programs for almost all multi-industry companies. They are back-to-work programs. Things have changed now. A lot of opportunities are out there. Once you're out of break, once you want to get back, the first thing anyone has to do is spend probably nine months or so. Get yourself skilled properly. Get your confidence back. You are probably one of the toppers in the college. You joined the first company. You came to your campus. You worked there for three or four years. So, what it takes now? who will go away anywhere just because of 3-4 years of break. So believe in yourself, spend that 9 minutes of time required for yourself, get your foundation skills back, start building smaller projects, get your confidence back. When it comes to job, search effort, yeah, there are three things. One, start applying for jobs and start applying for specific programs where companies are looking for back-to-work women. They typically give you 3-4 months internship, then they actually convert. Start applying for smaller companies, especially when you have a real portfolio, when you tell them I can actually do stuff, I can build a full-stack application from scratch, I have 10 back-end APIs, now I was like, let's just build back-end APIs. When you have a real skillset to showcase, a lot of small companies will hire you. So be prepared for only 6 months of effort due to the job search phase. Once you have the right skillset, once you have the right frame of mind, go through the job search process, it's absolutely possible for you to get back. We helped a lot of people. In fact, we helped somebody that in the last month I saw someone, the user who joined us almost a year back. career break right and and she actually was really really happy to see uh she actually finding a job right she actually took almost nine when she actually worked she worked in dot net okay and now she wants to get back she actually started learning javascript from the scratch and she has learned dsa she has built multiple projects in javascript end-to-end that kind of right when she applies for a job she's just not saying and wish to get back to work she says i have free site in full stack development in one stack i have students a project give me an opportunity a lot of companies are okay to hire dedicated people like that especially after someone uh like taking care of their people for four or five years right i would actually bet those kind of people any day right i think they have managed their time really well they have the highest determination to actually succeed a lot of companies will give opportunities for them right look for those back to work programs look for smaller companies who need to take a bet on you right and if you go on that path probably 18 months or so like nine months of kind of preparation six months of job search is definitely good with. Starting may be very very overwhelming, don't give up, take it calm, take it slow, it's definitely possible. Just following this path I believe we have opportunity to kind of transform if not millions at least lakhs of women who just are at career grade getting them back to their workforce. India is one of the lowest women participation in the workforce and we have smartest women out there. Definitely they can do it and we believe this path can help a lot of them right. All the best for lot of IHCs out there, yeah definitely you can do it."

        "transcription": "Hey, this is Dathina, co-founder of Career.org. This is Career Cafe. With my 8 years of experience working in tech, I have seen hundreds of successful engineers and their career paths in close quarters. And Cryo will help thousands of people to transform their tech careers. This is an attempt to share answers for most commonly asked questions based on curated insights and a very clear action plan to a larger audience. This is the Question Bowl, filled to the brim with a lot of burning questions. Today, we are going to take one of the most commonly asked questions, which is, I have been a manual tester for the last 4-5 years, can I get to automation testing? Let me throw some context. If you look at some of the world quality reports, in 2015, only 15% of the testing used to happen in an automated way. At the same time, in 2033, this number is above 63%. a product the first thing you think about how do I test this in automated way in a more scalable manner right. So now this question is a lot more relevant for a lot of people who are into automation manual testing careers think about how to plan for their automation stage right. Let me take an example of a user Amit. Amit let's say he's 2018 graduate working in the industry for last four to five years for one of the large multinational companies as a manual tester. It's in the financial services domain. He's really good at what he does right. He understands the product really well. He understands the domain and users really well and he like writes amazing test cases and tests manually. Unfortunately now even his company is moving towards automation testing but that's a different deal and he continued to work in manual testing knowing whatever role he does is probably not going to exist few years down the line. I think if you look at Amit from career perspective there are some challenges he faces. Why? He understands the role he is performing is not going to be relevant three years down the line. When he wants to go to Automation Testing, he is a bit out of touch, right? He has never programmed. He has started his career as a manual tester. He has the fear of programming, right? He doesn't know where to start in the automation journey. When you ask for an internal traction, that's not happening, right? When you start applying for automation jobs outside, people are asking for deliberate automation experience. I think that's where Amit and a lot of people like Amit are spare. Now, what do we do? What is the plan for Amit? Knowing that manual testing jobs are moving towards automation a few years down the line, it's very, very important for every manual tester to start thinking about how to translate their PV knowledge into automation testing knowledge. The transition to automation testing starts with they getting confidence about our programming language, right? Automation testing is generally done with, let's say, Java, some cases Python. Anybody who wants to get into automation testing has to pick a programming language. They need to learn one programming language, get comfortable with it. Let's say Amit picks up Java. He has to spend time. It will take probably a few months. months for him to learn the language and improve his basic programming skills with syntax all the libraries in the language. Next comes how to automate right let's say he goes to the java path he has to pick up selenium he has to pick up selenium probably start automating some simple ui tasks let's say i make travels home every week using redwest and he can start automating how i book my tickets in redwest using selenium that's a good starting point right once i make six months on it that's how he actually gains the confidence that he can program he can actually automate the next point for him to solve is how do we get opportunities right once he has a skill set we can go to his manager and talk about yeah this is what i've learned in last six months i can actually automate a lot of things what we're doing today that's a good starting point he can actually show the scripts he has written and actually show the github portfolio he has written himself by actually developing automation scripts right that's a very good starting point for you to ask for opportunities the moment you actually put your skills up front and ask for opportunities your team and management actually looks for you whenever there's next big problem they have to solve with automation With that, we can start applying jobs outside for automation testing goals. When he applies jobs outside, he is not just saying I've been doing manual testing, I want to get into automation. I've been doing manual testing. I've stayed in my sector for the last six months. This is my skill set. You can look at my demonstrable proof. That's when he actually makes his case very, very critical. So while you start doing it, you can actually start learning ABA testing. You can understand tools like Postman, Rest Assured. You start learning what is performance testing. It's not understanding how to generate traffic using JMeter, load testing. All of that you can start learning. This is exactly the path a cryo learner goes through. We help them to learn the language, get the confidence they can program. We help them to pick up simple frameworks, start with UI testing, then get into API and all the distributed system testing. And someone goes through this journey for six to nine months. After that, when they start, ask them for internal opportunities, start searching for a job. Opportunities start automatically opening up. I vividly remember three or four of these learners in the past. When I spoke to them, when I actually personally counseled them, I felt... they were really, really frustrated, right? And they lacked a lot of confidence. They had a lot of baggage, what they can do, what they cannot do, right? Once they went through Kaio Journey for six to nine months, I could see a completely different version of themselves, right? It was very, very satisfying to see some of them actually succeeding out of that. So for anyone who's looking to go from manual to automation testing, I would say, plan yourself to put effort for nine months to basket. Once you have the right skillset, because you're already a career professional, you understand how testing works. It's a matter of learning a language and who said it. Once you have that, you'll gain confidence to present yourself in front of opportunities, right? And that's when the opportunities start opening up. It's very much doable. All of you can actually get into automation testing with real confidence, right? You don't need to lose your previous skillset you already have, right? So have the confidence to put that effort and look for opportunities. All of you can actually move into automation engineer or SDL tools in the future. All the best. Thank you. you"

And after that I worked as a React developer, but I was lacking the proper knowledge where I have to start. I was not getting proper guidance. So through a friend, I came to know about Cryo. Through Cryo I came to know how to think, what technology we have to use to achieve that and proper guidance. It was a proper structure. It was very helpful for me. Cryo have amazing projects. It helps me to sort listing of my resume. I get many opportunities through that and through my project only I am able to crack the interview. Definitely my coding style was improved. It is learned by doing. If you have decided that you want to upskill yourself, then it will definitely help you and grow in your career. Through Cryo, I have a confidence that I can apply in any company, can crack any interview. "

So the winners in this category are all freshers and these are some of the best placements we have seen in the freshers category this year. Right? First up, we have Aman Ashar. Right? Aman Ashar got his first tech job at SpiceJet this year. Sanjay Mohan Kumar, first tech job at Hewlett Packard. He's actually here with us today. We'll hear from him very soon. Third winner is Sakshan Jain, who got their first tech job at Bank of America. And Neeraj D'Souza, who got their first tech job at Rakuten. Congratulations, Aman, Sakshan, Sanjay and Neeraj. You guys really hit it out of the park with your first tech jobs itself. So Sanjay.  Hewlett Packard is here with us today. Sanjay, would you like to share a few words of wisdom with the audience on how you actually did it? Hi, guys. Hi, everyone. Sorry, I can't turn on my camera. No problem. Yeah. Yeah. My name is Sanjay. I am a 2023 graduate, and I have completed my B.Tech in cybersecurity from VIT. And I was mainly focusing on networking. I was not 100% sure, like, that I know networking as well, like, clearly, so I wanted to switch my career to software. But at that time, I only know Python, that too, I did not know, like, how DSA works, how OOPS concept works, so I had zero knowledge on those. I was attending a cryo trial class during that time, like, beginning of my placement. And I like the way they teach. So I opted in for my upskilling as a backend developer. So yeah. And then the DSA concepts and then the poops and then the geek dress challenges were really helped me like I used to practice a lot in that so yeah those things were the main reasons like I got placed here and the career services team like they conducted mock interviews because this is my first career first tech job so I don't know how the interviews work so they helped me on that as I was saying like this is my first tech job the system design and then DSA part that really helped me a lot rather than concentrating on the code I can able to concentrate on a business logic and then business requirement a lot around and then code easily and then I can easily able to adapt to the new technologies that they are using in the companies as well yeah thank you for that thank you great thank you very much thank you very much and congratulations and welcome to the cryos hall of fame you"

We had companies like Makemetro, we had companies like India Times, Rediff. There are multiple factors. I think one, internet started becoming slightly mainstream. 2G came up, it became slightly mainstream. I think one big difference is compared to let's say the companies who were there before Flipkart. I think Flipkart was the first company who made a huge focus around customer experience. If you look at the biggest hurdle for online, anything online was trust. Flipkart focused rightly on customer experience and trust. I think of course it worked really well for them, then it scaled.

        "transcription": "Hi everyone welcome back in this particular video we will be discussing the problem named as binary tree level audit reversal we are given a binary tree what do you mean by given a binary tree given a binary tree means in the parameter there will be the root node of the binary tree given to us so tree node root is given to us we have to return the level audit reversal of its node values we have to do a level audit reversal that is we have to print all the node values of the tree in some particular order and that order is level by level top to down left to right that is left to right level by level we will print and we have to return it into a list of list as you can see on the right hand side we have to return it in a list of list and you can also see it from the sample output so let's read the complete problem statement note that input and output are being handled by main method behind the scenes you do not have to implement the main method or any input or output here the inputs are sent as arguments to the function you have to implement that is we do not have to make the binary tree we do not have to create it it is already created and given to us and also we do not need to print the output we only have to return it all the necessary code should be within the function we have to complete the function and we do not have to change the main method main method will be there behind the scenes it is not visible to us but we have to not change it okay very good what we have to do is we have to implement the function as told by using the parameters or the arguments as input and returning the answer as the output of the function the structure of the tree is given to you as a reference although we do not have to make modifications in the code step in the structure also that is structure is already given a root node having left child right child node having left and right child and if any of the child will be not there then it will be represented using null value or null node so input format as we know there will be some representation of a tree array like representation but we do not have to care about the input we have to just simply say that input will be a tree where n nodes will be there and n can be at minimum one that is at least there will be one node and at max 10 raise power 5 maximum number of nodes in the tree will be 10 raise power 5 and the values in the nodes will be from 1 to 10 raise power 9 that is all the values will be 32 bit integer output format we have to print each level of the tree of the binary tree in a new line that is we have to do level order traversal line wise every level should be printed in different line for this particular tree for the next level 3 comma 2 the next level 1 and each level should be printed from left to right see if we the second tree first level only five second level five comma two third level four comma five so let's take a tree which uh maybe have some more number of nodes so what we are saying is let's have 10 let's have 20 then let's have 30 let's have 40 50 maybe let's take 70 here or maybe let's take 60 here actually then let's take 70 let's take 80 let's take 90 and 100 and how are these nodes related to each other tens left child is 20 tens right child is 30 i am creating such a tree which should cover all the cases what are all the cases a node having both left child and right child like 10 20 and also some nodes only having the left child example is you can say uh maybe let's take an example of any one node which can have only left child let's actually make 40 have only left child and 50 will have both the left child and right child let's say 50 and 85 and what about 60 60 also have both the times but the 30 node is only having right side 40 node is only having left side and all of these nodes which you can see they do not have any of the children that is they are the leaf node they have both the left side and the right side as well so it is not necessary that all the leaves will be on the same level but this is one of the tree which is given as a input and what we have to do you have to print the tree level by level left to right top to down at this first level should contain 10 in a list i have to store 10 and return the list in the second list i have to store 20 comma 30 go level by level left to right and in the next level i should have 40 50 as well as a 60 then in the last level what should i do i should have 70 80 85 90 100 although the nodes which i have taken are in sorted order but it is not necessary it will always be like this particular ordering, it depends on how we are creating the binary tree or what is the input binary tree going to us. We have to store all of these levels into a 2d list and return that 2d list all together as a return type. So what should be the approach? See, if you have learned about DFS traversal, if you have learned about the depth firsters or you can say the preorder, inorder, postorder traversal, in those approaches, what we did, we used recursion to solve them. That is, we went to the depth at max depth as possible because from 10, we should go to 20, then 40, then 70, then explore the second branch, then third branch, then fourth branch, then fifth branch. But now in level order, what we have to do? First, we have to explore all the nodes in the first level, then all the nodes in the next level, then all the nodes in the next level. That is, first we have to travel all the nodes which the route is able to visit, then all the nodes which 20 is able to visit, then all the nodes which 30 is able to visit then 40 then 50 then 60 and then you can say all the leaf nodes finally so if we have to go level by level what data structure should I use in recursion we are using recursion call stack that is the first in last out policy leaf o policy or philo policy the node which is first inserted is last popped out but when it comes to level order we will be using queue data sector or you can say a data sector following people policy why we need people policy why we need first in first out if I am going to say first insert 10 then first 10 should be visited because in the first level 10 is there in next level 20 and 30 both should be visited one after the other that is both the children of 10 should be visited in next level now when it comes to 20 if we are saying next children or the next level nodes for 20 will be 40 and 50 40 and 50 we should visit 30 because we have to visit first level then second level then third level if we need 40 to be visited after 30 or you can say 30 to be visited before 40 then we need the first element which was inserted to be first removed also that is first visited also whatever element we will remove from data sector we can assume it is visited so if we are pushing first 10 it is first visited then 20 second visited then 30 fourth visited we are pushing both the children then when we will say visit 20 that is pop 20 we will visit both the children of 20 that is 40 and 50 so this will be the fourth node getting visited fifth node getting visited and so on so since we need the node which is getting inserted first to be popped out first to be visited first we need first in first out policy which can only be going by qdata sector anyways let's have a q and let's do what let's try to do the level order traversal but we have to make that we are doing it level by level. Since we are doing it level by level we need to make sure that how many nodes are in the current level. So initially obviously we have to start the traversal from some particular node because if the queue will be empty the traversal will not start at all. So what we have to do we have to start the traversal from the root node that is pretty obvious. So what we can do is we can push the root node itself directly into the queue and we have to make a queue of node and not of integers. Why of node because we have to go to the left subtree or the right subtree but if we are pushing integers we can't get the left subtree or the right subtree. So that's why we have to push the entire node itself. I am representing node using circle. So first we push 10 and now we will be starting the traversal. We are asking how many nodes are in the current queue. There is only one node. So let's just have an imaginary partition. Initially all the list will be empty. So what we will do is we will create a new list where we are going to insert all the nodes in the current level so since currently the size of q is 1 we will pop one node from the queue because there is only one node and add it in the error list that is added in the you can say dynamic array so one node in the first level which is 10. Now since we were able to pop one node in the next level we will be pushing it style because if a node is at level x the children of that node will be level x plus 1 so we will push them into the queue data sector because q is what going what is going to help me to print the node in level order so I will first push the left child then right child why because I want the traversal from left to right so I want 20 to be pushed first because first in first out then 30 to be pushed now since first level is done now we will be going to second level so for second level we will create a new list because we want all levels in different lists and we will figure out what is the size of q it is 2 so we will pop for two time we will visit two nodes in the current level what are those two nodes first node is 20 add 20 in the list the 1d list that is the second level and for the nodes which are the left child and right child of 20 we will push them into the queue because they should be visited in the next level so I will push 40 I will push 50 into the queue but size obviously will change of the queue but we have to make sure that the size variable for which we are running the loop should not change because first time we were running loop only for one time then two times then next time we will run it for more time depending on number of nodes so we do not have to make this size variable also get changed so we will make the size variable get fixed okay so we have pushed first node of the second level and now we will be pushing second node of the popping the second node of the second level which is 30 so visit 30 after visiting 30 in the next level the 30 children should be visited so we should push them into the queue. Only right child is there, so we will only push right child. If there is no left child, no need to push null node because null node is anyways an empty tree. So we can't just push empty trees into the queue. So in the next level, what we can see is the queue is having three number of nodes, that is size is three. So next level will be having three nodes. So we can create a list which will be growing dynamically or dynamic array or a dynamic list which will have three nodes. First node will be 40 and all the children of 40 will be pushed into the next level or imaginary next level into the queue. So that is 70, only left child is there, no right child is there. Then second node in the third level will be 50, so we will add 50. Same thing, since both the children will be on next level, this is level 3, this should be level 4. So we will push them into the queue to get visited as a part of next level. What about the node, the third node of third level, which is 60? add it in the list and I will say both the children of 60 should get visited as a part of next level. Let's for now ignore both of these nodes otherwise byron will go very large so finally again in the last level there are three nodes only so what we will say just run a loop for three times because size is three so make a list which will have three elements in the last first pop 70 add 17 into the list there are no children for 70 neither left child nor right child both are null actually so we will not push null children similarly for 80 we will add it in the list but no children are there and same goes for 85 we will add it in the list but no children are there and finally once the queue becomes empty again then we can say we have done the entire traversal and all of these 1d lists are inside a 2d list which we can return that is we are able to do level on a traversal line wise level by level by using a queue data sector by using FIFO policy so I hope the is clear to everyone, but before going to the instruction manual, we should discuss what is the time complexity associated with this approach, since we are going to push every node once into a queue data structure and in all programming languages, if you are using queue, which is implemented either using a double-ended queue or a linked list, the insertion time in queue is usually constant for single insertion and removal time is also constant for single removal. How many nodes are getting inserted in queue? Tree number of nodes, n number of nodes are getting inserted, whatever total nodes are in tree. So n insertions, so linear time, plus n removals, again linear. So two times linear time, which is still linear in nature, 2n is still n in big O time complexity. So time complexity will be linear. What about space complexity? Since we are using a queue data sector, which at any point of time can have two nodes or two levels, or maybe you can. say at most whatever nodes can be there in two consecutive levels and in one level can there can be at most n nodes usually if there is a complete binary tree kind of thing then we will have four nodes in this level and total there will be seven nodes so four is almost seven by two so we can say space complexity in worst case will go linear only because of the Q data structure we are taking extra space complexity extra auxiliary data structure so time and space both will be linear let's now jump on to the third milestone which is nothing but writing the instruction manual the corresponding instruction manual so what we have to do we have to create a queue of nodes create a queue of containing what containing nodes that is three nodes and let's say the queue name is Q only whatever language you are choosing most probably you will have a inbuilt function or inbuilt data structure which you can use to make instruction manual make you if not then you can make a queue on your own also anyways after creating a queue the second thing which we need is we have to push the root node if it is not null and in the question in the constraint it was mentioned that at least there will be one node so even if you do not check that the root is not null still it is going to be okay because root will never be null according to the constraints so we can just simply push the root node because if we are going to push null node we can't say null dot data we can't say null dot left subtree null dot right subtree so we have to push or you can say add the root node in the queue after pushing the root node now the traversal will start but before actually starting the traversal what we have to do we have to maintain a 2d array list so create a 2d array list create a 2d list of integers which will store all the levels so let's say this 2d list is named as levels only 2d list of integers named as levels now we can start the iteration now we can start the traversal so run a while loop till which point what was the ending point when the entire queue becomes empty we have to stop so we have to run the while loops till queues size queue size is more than zero we have to run and within this loop we have to not just simply pop nodes and push nodes we have to pop them according to the number of nodes in the current level that is we have to run a loop according to whatever the current size is of the queue so we have to figure out the size of queue store size of queue or number of nodes in queue in a variable and then run a loop for that many times now run a loop for size number of times so once we are running a loop for size number of times now we will say just pop the front node pop the node from queue pop a node Let's say the node name is current from queue and obviously we have to add it in a 1d RList but where do we have to create 1d RList before we are starting the current level we have to create a new RList once we were pushing 10 we were having new RList when we were pushing 20 a new RList when we were pushing 40 new RList whenever we are pushing the first node of every level we have to create a new RList that is before starting the loop create a 1d RList also so inside this outer loop or before this inner loop we have to create a 1d list and since 2d list was named as levels we will say 1d list is named as level a single level so pop the node and push or you can say add the nodes data into the list level list into the level 1d list once we have added the nodes data into the 1d RList now we can push both the left child and the right child what we did first we visited 10 visited 10 means add in the analyst or the dynamic array and then push the left child and the right child into the queue if they are not null so if the current's left node left child is not null then push it into the queue then push current's left in to the queue left child in queue and same goes for right child so i will have same thing if current's right child is not null then push current's right child into the queue if both are null do not push both of them if only left child is there only push left child if only right child is there only right child if both childs are not null then push both of them so pop the node add it in the list and then push both the children once this entire loop is done now we are sure that we have added or we have created the current level we have added all the nodes in the current level and whatever the current 1d list will be 1d list all these 1d lists are there first level second level third level fourth level all these levels are list we will add it into the global list that is 2d list so after the loop is done we will add the 1d list that is named as level into 2d list which is named as levels we will add the current level into the levels that is list of list and once this entire loop is done we are sure that we are done with the traversal we are done with the entire tree traversal in level order or you can say bfs breadth first traversal because we are going breadth wise level wise and finally we can of course return the 2d list return the 2d list levels so this should be the code if there will be some corner cases missing then we can handle them during the code time only when we will actually write the code from it but this is a self-explanatory pseudocode which you can use to actually do the inline expansion first of all what we have to do we have to create a queue containing nodes so how can we create a queue of nodes in Java we can say in the left-hand side queue q is an interface in Java of type 3 node q is equal to new maybe you can have a object of rdq or you can have a object of link list it is your wish I will be using rdq so this is creating an empty queue in Java actually we are just creating a DQ but pointing it as a queue but nevertheless once we have created a queue we have to add the root node in it so q dot add root node directly and we are sure actually right now that root will not be null so we can add it directly without checking whether root is not null because at least there was one node in the tree now we have to do what we have to create 2d levels so for now let's just ignore the 2d list part that is what we have to return for now let's just return null or maybe return empty our list and we will figure out how we can just maintain the 2d list let's just have the traversal for now and we will just see what is the output by printing it directly so we will run a while loop and what we will say we have to run it for all levels so outer loop will run level by level for all level and inside the outer loop what we have to do we have to run an inner loop for the current level for that many time whatever is the number of nodes into the queue so we have to first of all store the size of the current queue which can be extracted using q.size and now run a loop for that many number of times only so for int index is equals to 1 index is less than equal to size index plus plus that is running a loop for size number of times and once we are running a loop for size number of time what we have to do is pop the current node from the queue so let's just simply say what we are having the current node so re node with it is a three node only current is equals to Q dot remove remove is the function to pop a node from Q in Java once we have removed the node from Q what we can do is we can add it in the list but since right now we are not making list let us print it so system dot out dot print currents value the currents data that is val variable current dot val and let's just add a space so that all the outputs are had having space in between them then let's just run this much code and see what is happening right now if it is giving me the first node itself because I have not pushed the child nodes so it should be able to give me only the root node as output yes if the root node is four it is giving me only one output which is four but now let's do what let's add the children also so if the left child exists that is it is not null we have to add it into the queue and we have to say q dot add current dot left same goes for the right child if right child exists only and only then we have to add it if it is null no need to add a null node into the queue otherwise queue will become very fat like you are unnecessarily just pushing null nodes so let's run it again and see what is happening now it should actually print all the nodes present in the tree with spaces because we are not printing in different lines the all the levels in different lines there is slight error with semicolon in line number 47 let's just add semicolon and run it again and see if it is now able to print all the nodes level by level if in the first example we see output should be 4 then 3 then 2 then 1 and output is actually 4 then 3 then 2 then 1 but all the nodes right now are getting printed in same line what we can do is after the inner loop once all the nodes of a current level are printed of the inner loop we can add a new line just to be sure that we are doing it level by level and not just simply as a single traversal but we are doing it in multiple iterations first iteration first level second iteration second level and so on yes that is what we are getting now first level 4 second level 3 and 2 third level only one for the first example sample input let us also take the second sample input and see if it is going to give me the correct output or not the output should be 5 then 5 2 then 4 5 let's say if it is giving me the same output or not so there is some error with the type of input which I am providing to it but nevertheless since it is working for sample input let's just do what let's just create the list because we have to actually create a list and not just print so we will be saying create a 2d list that is list of list of integer let's say levels because it will store all the levels all the error lists and inside the loop for each level we have to create a 1d list so list of integer a single level list only a level is equal to new air list for each level. We have to create a new airlift so that we are creating it inside the loop because we wanted for new level a new air list and what we will do instead of just printing we will say level dot add the current value and instead of adding a space we will just simply said say level dot add and instead of adding a println we will say add the current level into the 2d level add the 1d list into the 2d list levels dot add level and obviously in the last we have to return the 2d levels the all the levels airlift the airlift containing all levels in level order traversal. So let's see now if the output which we are getting is correct or not. Let me just remove the custom test case. Let's run it again. It should give me the output as 4 then 3 2 then 1 let's see. So there is some problem with long cannot be converted to integer. So, why is it at giving me a error long cannot be converted to integer at line number 45. Let's see at line 45 we are having level.at current.val but val is a long variable and we want to store it as an integer so we can just do typecasting. We can just write integer in front of it because we want to store it as an integer we have to convert a bigger data type into a smaller data type that is we have to do explicit typecasting in Java. So, now it is working absolutely fine for sample test case. Let's also test it for some corner test cases and then we will submit what if there is only one node having value 10 and both the left child and right child are null minus one represents null actually in the sample input. So, it should only print one level containing 10 let's see if it is only printing 10 yes it is only printing 10 and what will happen if let's say we are having two nodes with the 10 and 20 values and 10 having left child as 20 and 20 having both the children as minus 1 that is null. So it should print me first level having value 10 second level having value 20 let's see. So expected output actually we have given the input in some wrong fashion maybe we have to go through this input format that how input is given but let's try to submit it and actually it is working for all dash cases. So the problem was not with the code problem was the way we were giving the input anyways the code is working but code is very big the traversal is very complex when it comes to coding part because we have to do it level by level and not the single level. So as you can see since we are doing the outer loop for all levels and inner loop for a single level will it go n square will it go n into n the answer is no it will still be linear the reason is the total time complexity will be the. number of times we are popping the nodes plus number of times we are pushing the nodes and how many nodes are getting pushed all the tree nodes that is n how many nodes are getting popped n so total time complexity will be n plus n which is 2n which is still linear in nature and what about space complexity since we are using a q or you can say iidq and which will require all the nodes of a current level to be pushed it will also go linear so both the time complexity as well as the space complexity will be linear for the problem level order traversal i hope the code as well as the fifth mile shown that is the corner test cases are clear to everyone so if you have any doubts you can reach out to us and till then keep coding keep hustling"

We would always focus on the implementation of the projects in colleges. The goal in mind, I would say, was only becoming a better developer, you know. In college, you don't think about, you know, design patterns and all. And this was like a first thing that we were taught, you know. You are familiarized with how the industry talks about things. One change I saw, you know, was that instead of thinking of implementation, I was thinking of how you can write your code. It was the first interview I gave, so they happened to ask me about my projects. They happened to look at the design patterns that we had implemented. Someone who is in college especially, it would be really beneficial to such a person to join Cryo. Instead of, you know, having a trial and error way of working through code, Cryo, like, puts in that set of principles that you have to work around while you are designing code. And also, at the same time, given that you are in college, it would be really helpful that you are understanding how the industry works. So, I would say, if someone... is coming and has an array of options. Instead of like randomly going through courses, it would be much beneficial if they went through Cryo and they got that experience."

And to crack the interview also, everything I learned at Cryo, it was useful. It took me about eight years to complete engineering. So I was not eligible for any placement in college, at least for the first six months. Later on, I came to know that we need good internships also to get resumes shortlisted. But it was too late. I don't come from a college which is what we generally call Tier 1 or Tier 2. It's a Tier 3, which many don't know about. If I applied to 100 or 200 companies, then I would only get shortlisted one or two. After coming to Cryo, the whole direction, or we can say, the whole path changed. After that, I came to know what steps I should be taking, what things I need to prepare on. My main drawback, we can say, in any interview was that I was just directly going to code. I was not even talking to the interviewer. And the first thing Sridhar sir told... in his session that you need to think loud because ultimately the process is important not the problem solved because they are the standard problems so that was the main thing that improved after coming to cryo then later on how to prepare resume everything was curated by cryo for my interview i was asked to design a system a mysql database from scratch and i was asked to implement the classes and the functions required for it if i was not in the cryo then i would have messed up it pretty badly actually if i was not in cryo i would have not cleared the first round only because the first round had six codes three easy level and three medium levels and it was near about two and a half hour so there i was able to convince my thought process to the interviewer and also solve the problem there were mock interviews also so it removed the fear of interview because previously when there was interview i was to what we can say be ready two hours three hours before sitting in front of laptops waiting like that but now it's now become habit i don't even think about it. I studied a lot before interview but the fear has gone. Even though you had knowledge, even if you can memorize every syntax, memorize every fact, but still you need some mentors or some directions to get to that point. If I have not been in cryo, I would have been the same, the problem solver where I used to code directly and waste 10 to 12 hours. It would have taken two or three years extra if I had not been part of cryo. Every knowledge I have got here, I can say just that whatever I am today is just due to cryo. Everything learned there, not just the technical things but how to talk to an interviewer, how to write a cover letter or how to get feedbacks from interviewer, how to ask the details or how to turn your question into something that interviewer might be interested in you. So it was an overall development, not just on the side of technical things also but soft skills also."

So like they were not, uh, very, you know, jumping to the next thing and, uh, they were not skipping anything. They were trying to teach us from the scratch and, you know, take it slow throughout the process. And they were also, uh, while teaching, they were also showing us by coding it so that we would not forget it easily. My name is Karthik Soni and I'm basically based in Delhi only. When I started working in my first company, in the beginning, I was being deployed in the, in a support project. So in the beginning I was thinking that maybe after some time, you know, they will change my project and like, uh, I would be working in the development environment, but even I asked my manager to change, so like he was also not very supportive in that. And I also thought that I even, I don't have that much knowledge of development. Like I was dependent on my company that they will teach me, but I think that's, that's the wrong thing. Then I thought of, you know, uh, join some course or some organization so that I could I will be confident enough to you know present myself in front of them then I chose cryo so basically I searched a lot of courses a lot of institution in the Google then I look through the reviews also on the Google and found the reviews genuine and authentic so that's why I found it interesting a lot of things were new to me so you know learning them and applying them it practically on projects and all so some things I have to learn myself also I found these things very interesting and to join a better company so that I will be in a development environment where I can grow as a software engineer and grow as a software developer and you know my future will be secure that's where I thought yes I took the right decision to choose cryo that sprint was like a base for me it's not spoon-feeding like everything work I won't teach you you have to learn some things from yourselves also so that's when some challenges came after completing those challenges I felt more confident that because everything they can't teach like development is so vast you know keep evolving yourself So they were also teaching us how to if any error comes or if anything comes how to overcome that by you know Looking up things like which particular thing you have to look in that and how to resolve it It was a great experience when finally it is like I have a good offer in my hand So yes, sir, I feel good about it There are good days and there are bad days, but they are not permanent like you have to keep on working on yourselves You can't sit idle and just pray for good things or then it will happen It won't happen like you have to work and you have to overcome the things but yes, if there are bad days then And if there are good days you should enjoy but you should be humble you should know that this is also Temporary so you should not stop working on yourselves even in good days So that's the thing that I feel that you should keep on working on yourselves Irrespective of good or bad days"

I think this is when GPT might need debugging because sometimes it'll give me a solution that doesn't work and then I ask, are you sure? And then it changes the solution. So it'll just keep changing as many times as you ask it. So this is a nice try, but not nice. Emotional support.

And after that, I was on a gap for six long years, searching online for the courses, what I can do, what is actually trending in the industry. That time I get to know about Cryo.org. So this is how it actually proceeded from my graduation to my career break, to starting my professional journey. I was very new to coding. I did not have any coding experience before. So once I joined the Cryo, first thing I have learned is JavaScript. And I had amazing experience while learning there. The learning is very structured, sorted, and very clear. They make sure that you are understanding everything from the core concept of the topic. Whatever knowledge I do have as a front-end developer, everything I have get through the Cryo itself. I enjoyed the most was the sessions. Sessions were really very interacting. When I have joined the Cryo, I really start liking the coding. They teach you how to proceed. for the solution. So, this I like the most. I would like to suggest that think about upscaling yourself at first, getting the knowledge. Even Cryo says that once you are able to complete the 70% of a course by your own self, by putting your efforts, then there is no one who can stop you to get the job."

        "transcription": "I was looking for some experience, some internship, something to put on the resume that was concrete. A friend slash mentor of mine actually recommended Cryo to me. Looking at the program and knowing that I required it, I was all in. Cryo curriculum actually sounded pretty perfect considering that they would give me resources. They would point me to where I can go and learn as much in depth as I can. And they would also give me exposure on the platform itself. Take me through it step by step but not holding my hand the way video tutorials or lectures normally do. That was the one aspect of Cryo that I really, really appreciate. Where you're left to your own devices and you have to figure it out. But the good thing is you also have some support. Everything was there from scratch, from the beginning with no prerequisites. With programming, I was always very scared doing it on my own. I generally did not like the red marks that I would see in my code. I was scared of receiving that. Cryo helped me overcome that fear of coding in a way. I was scared to fail before, make something that I did not know how to debug. But going through that project, going through everything step by step and understanding how to remove that error in a logical way, that helped me overcome my fear a lot. I was able to code from scratch and on my own. The entire step-by-step backend development that I did, when I was quizzed about it in my interview, I did not feel a single time that I did not know why this was working and what this part would do. Everything I'd learned, it just came out naturally. That is essentially what the company was looking for. It needed to understand how I was approaching the problem and whether I knew enough to approach the problem. A year before, if you'd asked me if I wanted to be a developer, I'd have said yes. If you asked me how you would do it, I would have said I have no idea. Maybe in less than six months, I realized I know more than I did a year ago. The possibility... The possibilities that I might go into seem boundless. Cryo taught me programming or software engineering isn't about the tool that you are using. It's about understanding what you're using, what it's doing and why you're doing it. Internalizing all these different lessons that I learned in programming gave me so much confidence that now I can confidently say, if you give me any technology, I can probably learn how to program in it, how to use it. It has given me that much belief in myself. I genuinely, genuinely love coding. A big hand has been Cryo's in removing my fear, in making me confident and showing me the parts without spoon feeding it to me."

        "transcription": "In this video, we are going to learn about two more identifiers with the help of which we can make variables in JavaScript. Okay, so before that we have to understand one use case. Now, what if we have a variable whose value should not change during the execution of the program? So it clearly means that you want to make a variable to which if you have once declared a particular value, it should never be redeclared, it should never be reassigned. Once the value is given, it should remain as a fixed value. So can we do something like that in JavaScript? Yes, we can. For that, we have an identifier which is known as const. Okay, so with var, what used to happen is redeclaration and reassignment both are allowed. But with const, once we are going to give a particular value, this value is going to remain fixed. The reassignment and redeclaration, both will not be allowed, which is why why this value is not allowed to be changed during the execution of the program. So how do we do this? We can do this easily with the help of const. So declaring a variable using const creates a variable whose value cannot be changed further. Right? So let's first of all take a quick demo of the same. Let's go back to repel it and we'll be making a new file for the scene. So let's just do variable identifiers.js. Okay, so let's make variables with const identifiers. So I can say const a equals five. Right? Let me do a console dot log of a. Let's see what is what is getting printed for the same. I can say node space variable identifiers.js. And as you can see, five easily gets printed. But what if If I try to update the value to something else, what happens then? Let's check that as well. If I try to do A equals to 6 and then a console.log of A, let's check if it is giving any error. And yes, as you can see there is a type error which says assignment to a constant variable and this is coming at line number 6. So it is clearly telling you that at line number 6 you're trying to do something which is invalid. Correct? So with const, once you have given a value 5, this is going to remain 5 during the execution of the program. You're neither allowed to reassign the value nor allowed to re-declare the value as well. Let us also have a look on the re-declaration case. What if I was going to say const A equals to 7 and then a console.log of A? Even in that case, let us see. It is still giving me an error that identifier A has already been declared. So it is clearly telling you that at line number 9, you're trying to declare an identifier A, which has already been declared above. So again, this is something invalid to do. So the overall conclusion for const is neither redeclaration nor reassignment. Both of them are not allowed. Okay. Now let's try to understand one more use case. Now let's say you have written a program containing 200 lines of code, right? So we are just imagining at that some line number seven, you must have declared a variable by using var. So maybe let's say you might have done something like var temp equals 10. Now, since you have written so much of code at some random line number 150, you have again declared a variable using temp because you've forgotten that you've already used the same named variable. And this time you said var temp equals to hello. Now I have a question for you. At line number 200, if I'm trying to say console.log of temp.  What is the value that is going to be printed? Is it going to be 10 or is it going to be hello? The correct answer is it is going to be hello because in JavaScript it's a line by line execution. So at line number seven you have said it to be 10 but once the execution reaches line number 150 the value is now updated to hello. It's already a redeclaration which has happened over here. So at line 200 you were expecting the value to be 10 but the answer came out to be hello. And to add more problems to that this value 10 is now thrown away from the memory. So you cannot recover that value as well. So just because of this human error due to redeclaration facility we were able to lose one important value from the program. So to avoid these kind of cases we have one more identifier which is known as let. We are going to make use of let this time instead of where okay and let's see how it can easily solve our problem. Before we try to understand let, let us take a demo of the same problem on Repl.it so that you can understand better. So moving back to Repl.it, let me just comment all of this and let's talk about let identifier now. So in let basically first of all let me give you the example of the problem with var. So folks let's say you are having something like var a equals 5 and now at some random place again you have done a var a equals 6 because of you have already forgotten that you have already used the name a above right. Now there will be no such error because var allows the redeclaration. So at line 50 if you were trying to do console.log of a this a is going to print me the value of 6 but I was expecting it to be a 5 and 5 is this value is now already gone away from the memory right. So to avoid these kind of cases we have something which is known as let. So now let's talk about let. let. So whenever you declare a variable with let, it is not going to allow us to redeclare but it is going to allow us to reassign. So if I say d equals to 8 now and then do a console.log of d, this value is going to be updated to 8. As you can see this is now updated to 8. But if I try to redeclare it, let d equals 8 and then a console.log of d, then it is going to throw me an error. And what is going to be that error? It's going to be a syntax error that identify d has already been declared. So what is the conclusion of let? That it doesn't allow you redeclaration but it definitely allows you reassignment. So the overall conclusion is that var allows redeclaration as well as reassignment, const neither allows redeclaration nor reassignment and let allows you reassignment but not the redeclaration. So in most of your use cases you should ideally be using let and const itself and that is what we have to learn about let and const. We are going to learn about the six cases associated with var, let and const, redeclaration and reassignments respectively. So here's a quick table of how we want to go about it. So with var, redeclaration and reassignment both are allowed. Let's see that with the help of a demo. So moving back to repel it, if I say var okay if I say var a equals 5 and I do a console.log of a that would clearly print me a 5. If I do a a equals to 6 and then again a console.log of a let's do that console.log of a. Let's quickly check if that is correct or not. As you can see we are also getting a 5 we are also getting a 6. So I can clearly say re-assignment is allowed. Let us also have a look on the re-declaration scenario where A equals 7 and then a console.log of A. What happens now? Even in this case 7 gets printed. So re-declaration is also allowed. I can say re-declaration is allowed. So in case of where re-assignment and re-declaration both are allowed which is what we can see over here as well. In case of let, re-declaration is not allowed but re-assignment is allowed. Let us see this case as well. So I'm going to comment all of this and check the same scenarios with let. I can say let B equals 6. Let's just console it as well to check the comparisons after which I want to say B equals to 7 and I can say console.log of B. Let's see if this is working or not. As you can see 7 is getting printed which means re-assignment is allowed, re-assignment is allowed. I should put a double slash over here to add it as a comment. Then let b equals 8 and console.log of b, is this allowed or not, let's check. And as you can see this time it is throwing an error that identifier b has already been declared. You're trying to declare it over here but it's already declared at line number 33 and with let re-declaration is not allowed. So I can say re-declaration is not allowed. And that is what is written over here as well. With let re-declaration won't be allowed but re-assignment would be allowed. Let's have a look on the two cases of const as well. Coming back to the replete, let's comment everything from here. And let's check all these cases const C equals 8 console.log of C. Just after that C equals to 9 and then again a console.log of C. What would happen in this case? As you can see it's a type error reassignment is not allowed. I can clearly say reassignment is not allowed. What happens in case of re declaration finally C equals to 10 console.log of C. Let's have a look on this one as well. And as you can see it's a syntax error this time that identifier C has already been declared. I can also show you by commenting this one. Let us now also check that. Even now it's the same set of error that identifier C has already been declared. Also re declaration is also not allowed. over here. Redeclaration is not allowed which is what we saw over here as well. With const neither redeclaration and nor reassignment both are not allowed. We are now going to perform an activity with let and const identifiers. So first of all let's get started with let. So here's a code snippet which is given to you and you have to redeclare a new variable using let which you can see clearly over here. So you have to identify what is going to be the output of this code. So pause the video right now and please check what is going to be the answer without executing the file first of all. All right. By now if you have already evaluated here's the correct answer. It is going to throw an error in this case and why is that because redeclaration with let is not allowed. Let's quickly have a demo of the same on replit. Let me just create a new file. activity4.js I can say let greeting equals hello and I can say console.log of greeting just after that if I say let greeting equals hi and then again console.log of greeting so you're going to get an error at line number 4 that you have done something invalid and how to execute this file you can again copy the file path from here paste it here and please wait for this to get ready and yes as you can see at line number 4 you got an error that identify greeting has already been declared. So getting a syntax error is the correct answer over here and as you can see that it's a syntax error over here as well. Let's go on to the next activity playing with const now here again you have a code snippet and you have to identify what is going to be the output of this code. So pause the video again and try to find out the answer. Alright, so by now if you have already calculated or evaluated your answers, the correct answer is again going to be an error and this time it's going to be a type error. Assignment to a constant variable. And why did that happen? Because with const, even reassignment is not allowed. Even reassignment is not allowed. So let's quickly perform this one as well over here. I can say const greeting equals hello and then greeting equals hi. So even if I don't console anything, the line number 8 itself is invalid. Correct? If I try to just execute this file, you can see at line number 8 there is a type error which says assignment to a constant variable. So this is also going to throw us in. error."

        "transcription": "Hey, this is Dathina, co-founder of Career.gov. This is Career Cafe. In our mission to transform millions of unemployed professionals, in the last four years, we helped thousands of people to transition from their current roles to better job roles to better earning potential. In our effort to spread the impact, we're collecting lots of common questions, and we're going to share answers to them as part of Career Cafe. Let me pick up the question for today. The question is, I've been working in production support for the last five years in one of India's large IT services companies. Can I get into development? This is one of the most commonly asked questions. In fact, I would say there's a story of more than a million people in our company. We call them unemployed professionals. Let me narrate the story with an example. example of our favorite character, Amit. Amit graduated in 2018 from a tier three college. He studied EC, he was a good student, very good academics, electronics, studying electronics, very good at extracurricular activities, but he was not into programming. The placement came, campus placement came, he sat through first day, he got into a large high sales companies who come to the campus on first day for a system engineer role. He was on and off of the main programming, he was excited to join the company, he went there, he went through a training, he spent about six months in training, he's learned some basic tools and technologies. After training, he was appointed with Bangalore as system engineer. His role was to do a production support for large multinational US bank, sitting over battle. But everything was new, he liked interacting with customers, he liked looking at what's happening around, he liked the corporate center, one part of it, two part of it. what he is doing is very very different today. He went through some programming training during the initial training period. He doesn't do any programming. He just keeps monitoring some systems. He does a little bit here and there, bug fixes. He was not sure where his career is going. And he started talking to some of his friends and colleagues at the office. In another 4-5 years, he has realized they're in the same place. Their career is not going anywhere. And he started looking at people around. He started looking at people working to spread the companies, developing those. Then he realized the job opportunities and the skills that Karate King carries is not going to take his career anywhere. This is not just Amit's story. We have almost more than a million people in the country who are working in large IT companies, doing non-development work, probably system administration, doing some maintenance, doing some production support. They are all great people with amazing potential. So Amit thinks, okay, it's not going anywhere. Let me start learning something. He tries to learn something. programming. He was not in touch. It was very, very difficult. He started losing confidence. He appealed for jobs. Nobody was shortlisting him. Time passed by. It's all those three years, four years. He continued to what he's doing. He got a couple of promotions in his current role and his salary at around 8 lakhs, right? At the same time, some of his classmates, probably from Tappers X department or other departments who've gone on to do a development work, they're salaried almost 3x, 4x. More than salary, he's not able to join his place with his current work, right? This is not just Amit, right? This is a story for a lot of people, right? What are the challenges Amit faces? Well, Amit does not have a basic skill set. He studied ECE. He got into an IT company. He's trained for some basic tools. He's never got comfortable programming or development himself. And in the course of the last three, four years, he understood that he is doing something. The career prospect is not very, very promising. When you want to learn, he lacks confidence. He made a couple of attempts. He could not... succeed, he loses confidence even further. At that time, Amit thinks, where are we going? He is getting a lot of self-doubt. I think that's where Amit is. So if you look at what Amit could do, we have a team of a lot of people like Amit to transform his career. It takes probably 18 to 24 months of effort. So what can Amit do? First thing Amit should believe is, he has a great partnership. He can definitely get into a better boat. He is in the current situation because of whatever happened in the past. Now we have to think how to do clarity. I want to be able to develop a code. Let's say that's a clarity task now. First thing you need to do is, spend some time improving his programming foundations. It could be any language, be it Java, JavaScript. It takes probably 2-3 months of hard work to strengthen his programming foundations. Then we need to strengthen a lot of software design foundations, like data structures, basic design space. It will take another 3-4 months. Then he needs to start learning it next time. He needs to first at least get some basic confidence. to build some very basic apps, right? He needs to go through a development journey, get help, go through the cycle of learning. Once you go through that, he'll ask for basic projects which he can showcase, right? It's exactly what we guide our learners at Cryo to do. Let's say after going to Cryo journey, our learners will have four to five industry level projects in their beta, which they can showcase as a skill set, demonstrable skill set. And they'll also have a good skill set on language, good programming skills, good problem solving skills. The question for these people once they have a skill set is, how do we make the job search? After five years working, let's say, the large company is at eight lakhs. The common dilemma in Google traces, if I change the job, move from company A to company B, I can easily get 30% height. That's always possible. But what they don't realize is, when does it stop? Right? So 30% dilemma is always there in all of the users' mind, especially after five years, they'll be, if I move to development, will they look at me as a fresher? Unfortunate reality is they'll realize this. Even after five years, they're at 8 lakh salary. A good qualified fresher even gets well after 3 lakh salary as a fresher also. So there's nothing to lose, right? Even at 8 lakhs, if they can actually move to a development role with a smaller company, they'll have better career prospect in terms of career growth, salary growth, all of it, right? So what they need to do is complete the preparation, right? In the job search journey, start eating at companies which is really to take a bet on. It won't be large companies, right? You have financial experience. They are saying you're as good as fresher. It's okay, right? Look at smaller companies who need to take a bet on you, right? So then a production support in Java, right? Improve your JavaScript. Build a test app expertise in Java. Start looking for companies. Start looking for companies. Whatever work they're doing correctly, go and start reading the code. Your work may not demand it. Start understanding what you're doing a lot more deeper. That will help you to portray your experience much, much deeper and much more specifically, right? So my advice to people like Amit, right? not developing growth in large services companies or it could be any company right. What is the development? First milestone is get comfortable with your foundations, get comfortable with your ability to build something, build your portfolio, show something for your interest right. Second step, while job search don't look for this is the high I need to get, this is the kind of only company I want to get. Look for the company which is going to give you a job to achieve, look for the company which is willing to take a bet on, go to that company. The job search process may take three months, six months, doesn't matter right. A lot of times you think is it too late, it's never too late right. You want to look at next 20-45 years of career ahead right. Five years is not too late right. Of course, if you get late you just go act on it right now right. So the the point is start preparing for it right. Look for 18 to 24 months plan, you can definitely get into the development role and your career trajectory is going to be very very different after that. All the best. you"

So when you're living in a city like Bangalore, then traffic is never your friend. That is why online map services such as Google Maps not only tell you the shortest route to your destination, but also the quickest. In the last video, we saw that how the data structure called graph made up of nodes and edges helps you move from one place to another. In this graph, each of the edges or routes connecting these nodes are represented with a weight value, converting it into a weighted graph. This weight value will define the time it will take for you to travel through a particular edge. Notice very lightly that most of these map services use algorithms like Dijkstra or Bellman Ford and their other variants. These algorithms are used to analyze the weight value of edges of all the possible paths to your destination and find the quickest. So this is how weight and graph with the help of other algorithms takes you to your destination right on time."

So if you guys would recall in case of switch break used to help us to come out of the loop or the switch. So same concept applies here also break will actually help you to come out of your fault loop. If you are using a break with a loop, it will help you to come out of the loop when a condition is fulfilled. So let's take an example to understand this better. Let me give you an example and we will try to understand this. Let me add a normal print statement here. Okay, so let's understand the problem statement now you have a for loop this for loop will help you to print all the numbers from 0 to 9 because the last condition is 9. So once I become 10 you will exit so it will help you to print all the numbers from 0 to 9 but there is a catch we are saying that okay whenever the value of I is equal to 3 right break out of the loop. So what will happen in this case whenever the value of I reaches to 3 when I becomes 3 right it will break out of the loop and it will come outside the loop over here. So your loop ends at line number 8 so your control will come to line number 9. Let me add a normal print statement here also. Outside loop so basically your flow of control will exit whenever I is equal to 3 your flow of. control will exit and it will come out of line number 9. We will do a dry run to understand break better. Okay, I is initially equal to 0 is 0 equal to 3 is this correct? No, so it will print the value. I I will be printed as 0. It will go to the next iteration. I value will become 1 is 1 equal to 3. No, so one will be print. Let's go to next iteration. I will become 2 is 2 equal to 3 is this correct is 2 equal to 3 is this correct? No, then it will execute to now to will be incremented to 3 again. We will have a check is 3 equal to 3 is this correct? Yes, now it is true. So it will encounter a break and it will exit the loop and come outside the loop. So you will get a output of outside you. So basically is 0 1 2 will be printed after that it will exit the loop and print the normal. print statement that is outside you let's run this and validate. Yes, so it has printed the number 0 1 and 2 and then it has come outside the loop. So in case of switch right in case of loop your break statement jumps out of the loop. Your break statements helps you to jump out of the loop. We have one more version available that is your continue. Let's try to understand what is continue. We will use that same code and we will try to understand continue continue basically means you want to skip only one iteration and rest all needs to be executed. So whenever you are in a loop, I want to skip when I is equal to 3 when I is equal to 3 right don't execute my loop execute it for all other values. So it will be executed. it for 0 1 2 but for 3 it will be skipped and it will continue normally for 4 5 6 7 8 9. Let's do a dry run to understand that. Okay. I value will be initially equal to 0 is 0 equal to 3. No, this is false. So 0 will be printed. Let's go to next value. I will be incremented to 1 is 1 equal to 3. No, that is also false. So 1 will be printed. I will be incremented to 2. We will check. Okay, is 2 equal to 3? No, that is also false. So 2 will be printed. I will be incremented to 3 is 3 equal to 3. Yes, that is correct. So continue will be executed and it will go back to your do and increment the value of I now I will be incremented to 4. We will check. Okay, is 4 equal to 3? No, that is false. So 4 will be printed. I will be incremented to 5 is 5 equal to 3. No, that is also 5 false. So 5 will be printed. It will be incremented to 6 is 6 equal to 3. No, that is also false. So 6 will be printed similarly 7 7 will be printed. Again. You will increment the value of I to 8 8 will be printed and the last value 99 will be printed because it will not execute the loop. Now it will check for 10. So 10 will not fulfill your condition. So it will come outside the loop and outside loop will be printed over here. So only the iteration 3 has to be skipped rest all will be executed. Let's run this and validate. So we are able to get the value of 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 as we predicted. So this completes our discussion around continue and break in case of loop. Thank you all."

Then my expectation was get into a project where I could use my skills. I started exploring cryo and then I found the material to be really enticing and it looked challenging as well. Before joining the program honestly I knew a bit of basics about JavaScript for React but I had never really done real world projects. This was kind of very different because there was no videos. Nobody was here to like hold your hand. So you had to do everything on your own. Just look at documentation, make use of the whatever materials that give you. Learning contract is pretty comprehensive. It gives you top to bottom pretty much everything but also you have to do your own research. The project had elements or things that you encounter in pretty much production applications. The recruiters they had a lot of questions about it. What was my approach to building these projects? I found it about cryo methodology. We look at problems and develop in different steps. That really changed the way how I look at some of the problems. It makes you practice pretty much every day. That really helps for you to keep coding, keep solving problems. Without practice, just watching tutorials or something is not helpful for development. The methodology, the technologies also gives you an idea of how it is in the real world. That made me more think like a developer."

        "transcription": "In this video, we're going to learn about relational operators. So to understand that, let's try to have one use case. So you must have used a lot of arithmetic operators till now to evaluate your mathematical expressions. Now, what if there is a use case that you are being given with two numbers and you want to check which number is greater? How can you do that easily in JavaScript? We can easily do that with the help of relational operators. So to check a relationship between two primitives or variables, we can make use of relational operators. Now, what all type of operators do we have in this category? We have greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, we have less than or equal to, we have equal to, we also have not equal to. So these are mainly the six operators that we need to consider. in case of relational operators. Now we also need to remember that in case of relational operator expressions, the answer is always going to come in a boolean. Either it can be a true or it can be a false. Let us try to make some examples on the same to understand this better. So I'm going back to repel it and let's make an example for each of these operators. So I'll say console.log of 3 greater than 4. Also console.log of 3 less than 4. Let's make a few more. Let's say 5 triple equals 5. Console.log of 5 triple equals 6. Console.log of 5 not equals to 6. Let's make this 6. Console.log of 5 not equals to 6. Console.log of 4 greater than equals to 3. Or console.log of 4 less than equals to 3. to 3. Alright, so now let's try to evaluate this first of all and check the answers. So I'll say node space relational expressions dot gs. Alright, so as you can see for the first one console dot log of 3 greater than 4. Now since that is not true, it directly gives me a false. Let's talk about 3 less than 4. Well, yes, that is totally true. The answer comes out to be true. 5 is equals to 5. We can see it true. 5 is equals to 6 comes out as a false. 5 is not equals to 6. Well, that is of course true. That comes out to be true. 4 is greater than or equals to 3. So whenever you have these two operators greater than or equal to less than or equal to. So either half the condition has to be true. In line number 6, 4 has either it has to be greater than 3 or it has to be equal to 3. So if either of the condition is true, the overall answer is true. overall answer comes out to be true. So in this case, 4 is greater. Automatically this becomes true. 4 is less than equals to 3. So you can clearly see that 4 is neither less than nor equals to 3. So in this case, it directly becomes false. So these are mainly the six set of relational operators that we have. Alright, coming back here. If we have some more demos, let's try to evaluate the answers of these right here itself. So you have two variables. Variable A is having 10. Variable B is having the value 20. So if I do a console.log of A triple equals B, what is going to be the answer? I think you should pause the video now and try to evaluate the answers on your own first of all. Well, you must have found out all the answers by now, but let us try to evaluate ourselves as well. So is 10 equals to 20? It is not. So the first one is going to evaluate to false is a greater than equals to be well that is also not true n is neither greater nor it is equal to 20 so the second one also evaluates to false a is less than equals to be well that is going to be true because n is less than 20 so this comes out to be true a is not equals to be well that is totally true n can never be equal to 20 so this also comes out to be true so the first two evaluates out to false the next two are going to evaluate to true we are going to talk about logical operators and to understand that let's have one use case so let's say eligibility criteria for a certain college courses your age has to be greater than equals to 21 also you should have more than two degree certificates so you're only eligible to take an admission to this college course when you fulfill both of these criterias. Now only if both of these conditions are met, then the candidate can apply. So how do we handle such kind of scenarios in JavaScript? Well, for that we have the concept of logical operators. So the first logical operator that we are going to learn today is going to be known as AND operator. In JavaScript, we write it as double ampersand marks. So it returns a true only if both the conditions are true. If the first condition itself is false, it will not even check for the second condition. So the concept of AND operator is pretty simple. Let us say you have two conditions A and B. Now if both the conditions are true, then your resultant answer is also going to be true. Even if either of those conditions comes out to be false, the total resultant answer is going to be false. We have a second operator as well, which is known as OR operator. We denote it by. 2 pipeline marks in JavaScript. Now this returns true if any of the conditions are true. Again let us take the same example. Let's say you have 2 conditions A and B. Now if either of the conditions are also true, the overall result comes out to be true. It will not even check for the second condition in case the first condition itself is true. So let us take some examples for both of these scenarios. So let's go to Rebelit and let me make two variables and let's take the same use case as we just saw. So let's say age is equals to 22 and let me just call the second variable as degree certificate. I'll just write the short form for that and let's just say that this has 3. So now console.log age greater than equals 21. and degree certificate greater than two. Let us first of all check the answer and then let's try to check how did this come up. So node space logical operators.js and as you can see the answer comes out to be true. Now how exactly did this work? There were two conditions that we evaluated with the help of and operator. Let's say this is the first condition and this is the second condition. So currently our age is 22 is it greater than or equal to 21 well yes it is. So our first condition evaluates to true. Let's talk about the degree certificate. Currently we have three degree certificates. Is it greater than two? Yes it is. So when both of my first and second conditions are true the overall result also came out to be true. Let me reduce this to just one and now let's try to evaluate the same. You can see the answer now comes out to be false. So even if I of the condition is false the overall answer is going to become false. Also if this was going to remain as 3 and this was going to be reduced to 20 in such a case our first condition itself becomes false. So whenever your first condition itself is false it doesn't even check for the second condition because now the AND operator already knows the overall answer has to be a false. So let's verify that as well. In this case also you can see the answer comes out to be a false. Let us take a similar example but this time with the help of OR operator. So what if I do a console.log of age greater than equals 21 OR degree certificate greater than 2. Now let us check the answer. This time for OR operator you can see the answer came out to be true. Why did that happen? Because again we had two conditions. conditions, but one of them is true. The first one was a false condition, but the second one is a true. So false or true together makes a true. If either of the condition is true, the overall result comes out to be a true. So this is how we have to know about AND operator and OR operator. Now here's a quick summarization of whatever we have learned about AND operator and OR operator. So whenever we have both the conditions as true, in case of AND operator, the answer comes out to be true. Rest in every case, you can see it is a false. When we talk about OR operator, only when both the conditions are false, the answer is false. Rest in every three other cases possible, the answer is coming out as true. You have to perform an activity on checking relationships using relational operators and logical operators. So you have two variables. Let us say A is equal to 10. b is equals to 20. Now you have to identify what is going to be the answer in case of these two console.logs. So pause the video right now and try to evaluate it on your own. So by now, if you have already done it, that's pretty great. Let me help you out if you have not done it yet. So a is not equals to b in the first console.log. Well, that is true. And a greater than b. Well, the second condition over here is false. So true and false together makes a false. So the answer for the first console.log comes out to be a false. Let's take a look at the second one. a is not equals to b, which is again a true, or a greater than b, which is a false. So true or false actually makes it true itself. So for the second console.log, the answer is going to be a true. So the first one was false. The second console.log is true. Thanks for playing. Happy Singing!

There are already a lot of job cuts that we have seen over the last one or two years. People always have this fear of recession, probably every seven years. And with JNA coming in, will it compound? Will jobs kind of reduce? Every fundamental shift in the way technology has worked has only created more and more interesting jobs and interesting opportunities. Will some jobs go? Yes. The most basic, mundane coding jobs, chatGPT can replace. What kind of jobs will be there? Hard to be very exact about it, but within companies, prototyping new websites are far more common. much faster, competent developer can take the help of, you know, AI tools in order to prototype things faster, take it from idea to solution much faster. So I don't need as many developers to do the same amount of work, right? Doesn't mean that the person who is using these AI tools, and then building out solutions for the company can can can take it easy. I mean, they'll they'll have a really good job on their hands, they still have to have the customer understanding the market understanding the product sense and all those things have to come in. They are the ones who know where this product is going to go in the future and factoring all of that into today's designs. It still needs a very, very competent programmer. But you don't need someone who just basically do a very small prototype to see if things can work in in more hardware type of companies where you have to write device drivers and things like that. If you feed in, say, a pin out sheet of particular microprocessor and something that comes with it, in terms of a trading value, then generating, you know, you know, bring up software and things like that should be fairly straightforward going forward. I mean, it might make some of those jobs a little bit redundant. Today's a very specialized job bringing up a microprocessor board and on a PCB is actually very specialized. It needs understanding of several things, you know, including basic electronics and how microprocessors work. Maybe a lot of that can be commoditized, because AI does it much better. And there's plenty of training data available there, you know, so to train on a vast amount of code already available, and then using that information and knowledge to bring up new software on new boards and things that should be simpler. Some jobs will go. But more interesting I think jobs will come and they'll be large in number, you know, because it just shifts the goalposts of what needs to be solved. You know, previously people wrote a lot of frameworks, a lot of code in order to serve websites. Frameworks came, some jobs went, but more jobs, yes, a huge appetite for more jobs."

        "transcription": "When I shifted from electronics to software development, the biggest thing which I was missing was self-confidence. Like, am I doing some mistake? Is it too late to switch? Will I be doing something good in this part or not? First thought which came in my mind was just it would be providing some video lectures or some question tasks to perform, but it was completely different when I joined. They provided us with a set of projects. Those projects were also broke down into various modules which we had to complete. Those really helped me to get deeper into software development, got the basic idea about them. Best thing about those modules were you were not provided a direct video lecture on those modules, like how to solve the particular problem mentioned in the module. You were provided some links where you have to go and read yourself. So that's the best thing about Cryo that they wanted us to read by our own and then understand the concept through reading. And then implement it in those modules. better idea of all those stuff. I went on to discover various things about that concept, not getting into a particular video and just going through that. There were many stuff which I didn't do at all before. I had to start all these things from basics. So I started reading about all those things. Those moments were there when I was stuck on some bug and there is a live session that they are going to, they are going to describe about this module or get you some help. They were not mentioning the direct thing which we have to do. They were like, read this thing, you have to progress in this way. They were not actually mentioning what we exactly have to do. And that, that I think was the best part because we still had to discover what exactly we need to do even after getting the help from mentors. But that really gave us the support, those videos, those live sessions really were helpful in discovering those things. And of course, when you go through software development at that deeper level, you do things with yourself, like you get some hands-on experience, you discover concepts by yourself. Of course, you get some self-confidence and all those things and it really helps you to explore further opportunities in your career. These projects helped me in a lot of ways. I didn't had any project, of course, when I switched to software development. These gave me something to write on my resume, first of all. Then the best thing about those projects were you were not told to write only the code. You needed to write code which is modular, which is clean, which can be extended if any feature is there to extend. And these skills are really helpful when you join a company. Most of the college students tend to miss out on these skills when they work on their particular project in college days. They don't focus on clean code or modular code. But these are the things you require when you join a company. And for me, the journey was smoother when I joined at Grab because I already knew all these things when I was in cryo. I believe that if I haven't followed that learn by doing approach, I wouldn't have been like I wouldn't have been this confident like I am now and yeah I feel confident at this point of time that yeah I can solve a problem which is kept in front of me."

Do all this stuff. Remember that you messed up in those things. Now you have to see the documentation, the blogs. And in the company also, most of the senior devs, they are not having free time to just help their interns or junior devs. So I have to do this research by myself. I thought that there was a lack of a structured curriculum from which I can start my journey. That was the main important thing that I got from Cryo. How to structure a project, how to work in a structured manner, in a step-by-step manner, in a logical manner. It has a very different strategy of teaching people. Learning content was very... good. They have started from the basics and they increase the complexity in a very sorted manner.

Currently working as a coder, assistant program. What do you think is a common misconception that people have about working in tech? Like there is a lot of competition, struggle and no enough growth. Currently I am in the government sector, so I cannot comment much about the corporate. Your most favourite and least favourite part of your job? The most favourite part is the stability and the security. And being an armed forces, we have a hectic schedule, that is it. And frequent relocation to different places. So in your tech career, what was the biggest hurdle you faced and how did you overcome it? Like the biggest hurdle in my tech career was... learning new technologies you know because we being a government organization we have some legacy systems that we wanted to migrate to the newer technology so that was one of the major hurdle that I had faced. Thank you so much."

        "transcription": "I did my BTech in computer science from BML Munjali University in Gurgaon. And before joining Google, I was an intern in Oakley Credit. One of the common perceptions that we have in a college is, you work on a project, so you need to start from the scratch. That was the first thing which we learned at Cryo, that everything is built up. And if you need to add a feature, you will be adding that in a code base, which is already there for you. It might look easy to just add a new feature in the code base, but you need to understand the flow of the code base, what functions are doing what task and when you need to insert your feature into there, so how it will be communicating with other parts of the code base. So that is something which is missing in the college project and which was very well taught in Cryo. This whole flow is kind of very much what we do in an internship. Everybody. Every new task or every new mini project that was started was given in the form of some statements which a team lead would tell you, like these are the things we need to do. So you think about those problems, the architecture is given, right? And then it is not stopped at that point of time. Even after that, how you proceed into a task, how you start doing a task and what are the key elements you should focus on, what are the things you should learn before doing that task, all those things are kept into mind and it is a very beautifully organized material and the help, the community which is provided by Cryo, that is also very great. There was no point of time during the whole journey that I felt that I am not able to understand and I'm not able to get the help from anywhere. Having the Cryo experience was a very good experience. a good plus point while getting that internship, because I was asked questions like, how would you build this thing? Or how does the back end for this look like the basic concepts which are covered in cryo. And even while making some projects, when I had to work on the back end, so since I had done cryo, and I knew that how the flow should work. So that helped me a lot for making those projects also. And those are one of the best projects on my resume right now, which I did personally and I use the concepts I learned at cryo. If I speak for Google specifically, I think mentioning the three main projects which I did that cryo was a good part on my resume. And obviously, the competitive coding part also was covered a little bit in cryo. So overall, I guess, in every part, there is some contribution of cryo in my journey. If you're coming here, so that you will be taught something, you will be spoon fed. or you'll just get an extra project on resume but not doing much then it is not the right option. You'll have to work hard. You'll have to put in effort on learning new things. It might the deadlines might become a little bit hectic on you so that you have to learn how to take that pressure on you and if you're coming here for learning new things and learning how to build a particular project how the flow works and basically how would you intern at a company then this is the best place you can find. This is what student needs to do before getting into company because once you get into a company then learning at that point of time might become a little bit difficult for people. So if you know that what kind of work you'll be doing when you join a company then it is much better and in addition to learning you get a lot of. cool projects on your resume, so that is always a plus point."

        "transcription": "Are you in two minds about upgrading your career? Let me guess. It is because you have signed a bond in your current company. Does that mean you have to wait for the bond to expire to upgrade your job? Hi, I'm Rithvik and in this video, we'll discuss how can you go about breaking the bond with your company and what is the right way to do it. Before we begin, let's try to understand what exactly is a bond. Bond is a document, a contract which you sign when you join a new company. This contract states that you will have to work a specific period of time before you can leave the company. This time is around two to three years. And if you break the bond, that is, if you leave the company before the specified period of time, you will have to pay some amount of money called liquidated damages. Is bond a legal document? it? Yes. Does that mean you cannot break a bond? Absolutely not. Then why do companies make you sign a bond? Let's say you're a fresher straight out of college or you're not fully qualified for the job. In these two cases, the company has to spend a lot of time and effort so that it can train you so that you can perform the job appropriately. Now if you choose to leave the company for whatsoever reason, the company has to incur a lot of losses in terms of capital, human resources and the effort it puts into training you. It is mainly for this reason companies ask you to sign a bond so that it can compensate for the losses in case you leave. Now that you have understood the fundamentals behind bonds, let's try to understand how you can break a bond with minimal damages. First thing is you should check with your employer what their policies are. Many companies are very flexible. If you serve some amount of notice period, then you don't have to pay any liquidated damages. This would be the best case scenario because you're not paying any amount if you leave. So make sure you check this option. before going further. Now suppose you don't have this option, you have to pay the liquidated damages if you leave the company. I'll show you how you can leave your current organization by identifying the opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is the value you lose when choosing between two or more options. We'll see how you can calculate the opportunity cost so that you can make the most profitable decision. Let's say in your current company, you're earning 3.5 lakh rupees per hour. If you change your job and go to your next company, you'll earn 6 lakh rupees per hour. And as per the contract which you have signed, if you leave before two years, you'll have to pay 2 lakh rupees. Case 1, let's say you don't take the offer and continue working in your current company. In this case, by the end of two years, you'll have 7 lakh rupees. 3.5 lakhs plus 3.5 lakhs. Simple. Case 2, now let's say you want to change your jobs just after two months you signed the bond. In this case, you'll earn 12 lakh rupees, 6 lakhs plus 6 lakhs. And you'll pay 2 lakh rupees as the bond. breaking liquidated damages, then that would amount to 10 lakhs that is still 3 lakhs more than case one. Now your next question might be how do I arrange for this money? How do I arrange for 2 lakhs so that I can change my job and go to the next one? I'll walk you through three ways to ease this out for you. One, take a personal loan showing the offer letter from your next company. Two, you can always negotiate for a joining bonus in the next company. Most companies are accommodating of this request. Three, you can ask your friends and family to lend you the money which you can pay back in installments. Even though we have been through cases in which you can break the bond in a profitable way. Some of you still might be wondering that this does not apply to me because you have already spent 3 to 12 months in your current company. Say you have spent one year in your current company and you have one more year remaining in your bond. If you stay this one year, then you will have 3.5 lakh rupees. But if you change your job, you will have 4 lakh rupees. 6 lakhs from your salary and 2 lakhs from your bond. because you'll be breaking the bond. Leaving is still profitable because your next salary bump will be based on your second salary which is 6 lakh rupees not 3.5 lakh rupees. So, if you have been waiting for the bond period to end so that you can take a decision about your next steps, I think you should rethink this decision because you see bonds need not always be a roadblock to moving your career ahead. However, if you wish to fulfill the bond period or go for better opportunities, that is totally your decision.

I think being a good problem solver, being a good programmer is kind of essential for you to build any further paths in software engineering, I would say. If I am a freshman getting out of college, how should I think about what my area of interest is and how should I proceed towards it? Yeah, I would say don't bother, right? Right, I think I just had advising my cousin over the weekend during Pongal holidays, let me repeat that, right? So, see I think generally people get lost especially in the beginning of the career if you're in the final year of college or in the beginning of the career, right? Don't think too much about specializing in, let's say, I want to be an ML engineer, I wanted to be a, should I be a back-end developer, should I be a front-end developer? Lot of times I've seen people asking all these questions don't end up doing anything, right? So, I would say be a... programmer. Pick up any programming language. Be very very comfortable in any one programming language. Get started with something. I think if you have not joined the first company and I think try to join a good place, a good company which gives you a development opportunity. Any language, it could be a back-end developer role, it could be a full-stack developer role. Don't try to do too much specialization, don't think too much about it without even knowing deep about it. I think being a good problem solver, being a good programmer is the base skill for you to do anything. I think don't get lost. Should I focus on security? Should I focus on let's say infrastructure engineering? Should I focus on SRE? Should I focus on... and a lot of people come and ask me, I don't want to do programming. How do I get into tech? And people think they can be a QA engineer without knowing programming. So I think those days are kind of going. If you want to be a meaningful role in tech, you need to be a good programmer. And if you have some fear of programming, you just get rid of it. You get used to it. And you spend some time. Whatever amount of hard work is required to put that and get that out of your way. Can you quantify the amount of hard work required? I think someone is reasonable aptitude, someone has gone through engineering, gone through any of the degree and passed it. I would say they can be a programmer if they spend. I think they can be a meaningful, let's say, programmer plus they can do some building work with some tech stack in seven, eight months, seven, eight months, yeah, it would require seven, eight months of hard work, right? Initially, if you have not done any coding in college, if you're just starting, it may be overwhelming. But we are very, very focused. Seven, eight months is a good time where you can comfortable, you can say I can build a decent, you know, let's say JavaScript as a programming language, I can build a reason front-end, I know some basic frameworks there, especially in computer science engineering, there are a lot of things people can do, right? People can focus on data engineering, they can focus on let's say ML engineering, they can be very very focused back-end developer, very focused front-end engineer, right? All those things can potentially happen once you have a bit more exposure, potentially post your first job also. Usually after it's three, four, five years. Yeah, a couple of years you know probably this is what you like most, you can actually specialize. But I think having a fundamental programming knowledge, at least one tech stack understanding is critical for everyone, right? I think I get this question a lot, especially for ML, right? So can I be a data scientist, right? So you are doing undergrad, right? You have not done some research, you have not done master's or PhD, know some of the algorithms really deeper, even go and build one, right? I think you can just be a developer, right? If you want to focus on ML engineering, if you want to use, build a lot of products using ML or even if you want to become a kind of a data scientist, you can of course specialize later, right? You don't know programming, you just graduated out of undergrad school, right? Becoming a data scientist is not the path, it's possible, right? So people get generally lost with a lot of noise, right? I think being a good problem solver, being a good programmer is kind of essential for you to build any further path in software engineering, I would say."

        "transcription": "Hey, this is Rathina, co-founder at Career.do. This is Career Cafe. Today, we're going to discuss some of the most frequently asked questions you've received while working with a lot of tech professionals in the past four years. I've been in the tech industry for the last 18 years or so and faced a lot of career dilemmas and helped a lot of thousands of people while being part of Cryo. Today, we want to talk about a question which is most commonly asked. While looking at career transition, what should I focus more? Should it be a better job role, better salary, better branded company? So, let me explain this with an example. Let's again take Amit. Amit is working as a manual tester for the last three years. He wants to move to a development role. He feels the career prospects of being a manual tester is not good enough for him and he aspires to become a developer. Currently, Amit earns 9 lakhs per annum. wants to move to developer role, and he also thinks, even if I change a job right now, I'll probably get a job for 11, 12 lakhs for a manual testing role. So when I become developer, I should probably get 12 lakhs per annum. He also thinks he wants to get into better branded product companies. He currently works for a large services company. So if you look at his career aspirations, he has three dimensions. One, he wants to move from manual testing into developer role. He wants to move his salary also in developer role from nine lakh current salary to 12 lakhs. He also wants to move from large services companies into better branded product company. When you think about career transition, right? So a lot of times people have very, very broad goals and without any sense of priority. Let me throw a scenario. Let's say Amit gets an opportunity to move to a developer role. Currently he earns nine lakh as a manual tester. Let's say if he gets a developer role for eight lakhs per annum, should he take it or not take it? Of course, it's a personal choice, right? And my recommendation for him would be, he should take it. A lot of times people have to prioritize and trade-off. trade-offs while making a career transition. My personal preference would be when you want to move to a better role, first prioritize the job role. Then think about working with branded companies and better people. Then think about salaries. Of course, it can be different for you. But one thing I can say for sure, if you don't have a sense of priority, your career transition effort can be very, very directionless and it may be very, very confusing. So you might actually end up losing track of it. So have a very clear priority of what you want to focus on and plan your career transition efforts. That's all for today, folks. If you have more questions, leave them in the comments, we'll pick them up and put in the questions bowl. See you in the next video."

They also look at some other hobbies that you have pursued, your communication skills also are very important. Some colleges ask you to write a statement of purpose and how you articulate why you want to go there and what you want to do later.

        "transcription": "Have these thoughts ever crossed your mind? Why am I spending so many hours practicing hundreds of data structure problems? Will I ever use these concepts in my day to day work? If I'm never going to invert a binary search tree in my software life, why are they asking me this during interviews? Shouldn't the interviews test me based on my development skills rather than DSA? So what's the point of learning all this? Why and how companies use DSA as a benchmark? Hi, I'm Hrithvik and today we'll decode the importance of DSA for the interview and how much preparation is actually required to nail your interviews. If you're new to the channel, be sure to subscribe and hit that bell icon so that you're the first one to know whenever a new video comes out in the Decoded Careers in Tech series. DSA is all about solving a critical problem with a logical approach, meaning you identify the right set of tools and apply them to solve a given problem. In software lingo, people may also refer to this as PSDS, Problem Solving and data structures. Companies commonly use it during interviews to determine how good of a software engineer can you be. Let's understand what is good and bad about this practice and more importantly what should you be doing. Companies use DSA interviews to test you in two ways. One is through online screening and two personal interviews. Though in both cases you as a candidate are going to write code to solve common DSA problem. There are some nuances that are worth understanding. Let's get to the bottom of that. Let's say you have an opening in your team. 500 people apply for the role and your recruiter helps you shortlist 100 candidates based on resume match. However, now you can call only 20 candidates for an interview. How do you decide who to call? This is the most common dilemma companies face. One of the easiest and most objective ways is to conduct an online coding assessment on platforms like HackerRank. This helps to further filter out candidates and call the top 20 for an interview. Let's understand why this works beautifully for you and the company. The company spends less than one to two hours setting up the problem on HackerRank and they get automated leaderboard results from the platform. At the same time, you as a candidate spend two hours or less of your time on the coding assessment to go to the next stage. Imagine an alternative scenario where coding assessments don't exist. Companies would ask all candidates to build a project that would take less than 12 hours. They would then have to build automatic assessments to evaluate the project, which is an additional 20 plus hours of work for their engineers. And at the end, candidates who get rejected would have to spend 12 or more hours of their precious time on an assignment that is not useful anymore. Now you see how and why coding assessments are used to shortlist candidates. Through these tests, it's fairly easy for companies to evaluate your coding abilities and your problem solving skills. However, you might be wondering why some tests are just so impossible to crack. Well, here's the real reason behind it. Companies don't want all candidates to have the same score, because then it becomes tough for them to shortlist again. So when there are two or more candidates competing for the same role, these tests are designed to be harder such that there is a distinct rank for every candidate. So do you agree that online assessments are a good way to shortlist candidates? If you have another opinion, do let us know in the comments. We'd love to know your perspective on this. and if you have made this far in the video, don't forget to hit that thumbs up button before we move on to the next part. If you make it through the coding assessment round, your next challenge would be to pass the in-person interview rounds. Apart from coding ability and DSA knowledge, the in-person rounds aim to assessing a few more specific skills. Like, are you able to ask the right questions while solving the problem? How many types of solutions are you able to come up with for the same problem? What kind of trade-offs are you making to choose the best solution? Interviewers dig deep to see how you do from these aspects of problem solving. And for debugging, they are mostly concerned with how you debug your code when you face issues. Are you approaching it in a structured fashion? One thing to note here is that well-prepared interviewers don't usually ask standard lead code problems. They give you more realistic problems to solve and see how you approach them. Even if the questions are hard, they aren't expecting you to give the final solution. They just want to see how you are approaching it. In other words, in online assessments, companies are looking only at your final output. In personal interviews, the journey you took to arrive to the solution is considered equally important. Now that we have seen the fundamental... ideas behind asking DSA problems during interviews, let's look at how effectively they are evaluating your skills for the job. DSA interviews give a fair estimate of your cognitive abilities, problem-solving skills, coding abilities, and debugging skills. This is during a personal interview like we saw earlier. With this perspective in mind, how can you make the most of your DSA interviews? Given the number of resources available to help you with DSA problems asked in interviews, it's easy to get lost in the rabbit hole of spending crazy number of hours practicing 400 to 500 problems before your interview. Slowly, it also started becoming a proxy of how prepared you are more than how good of a problem solver you are. Preparedness is equally important attribute companies look for. So, companies keep bumping up the difficulty of these DSA problems during interviews to the extent they can't differentiate between multiple candidates who have solved 400-plus problems. This is another reason why DSA interviews have become five to six times more difficult than what is necessary for you to be a good software developer. So, how much should you prepare prior to an interview? Before we get into the details of what topics you have to pick and prepare for your upcoming interviews, let us know that are enjoying this video by clicking that thumbs up icon. And once you have done that, let's continue. If you are going to interview for a front-end developer role, you can focus on topics like arrays, strings, maps, simple implementation problems. If you're interviewing with companies for backend roles, the list of topics is slightly longer for you. Try the level-by-level approach when you're practicing problems on these topics. That is, first get comfortable with arrays, strings, linked list, and simple implementation problems. Then move on to hash, queue, stack, and trees application. And finally, cover graph, DP, and recursion. Regardless of how good you are at development, you most definitely need to work on improving your problem-solving skills to get past the interview rounds. You can't escape it. You have seen why companies adopt DSA tests to shortlist candidates and they are surely not going to change their selection process in many years to come. If you're feeling overwhelmed or don't know where to start your prep, we have got you covered in our DSA preparation for interviews video. It explains everything from how many problems to solve, where to find the problems, and what topics you need to focus on based on the CTC you are aiming for. Check it out. I've added the link to it in the description. This video has helped you appreciate why companies test your DSA skills for a software development job. If you think you learned something new, don't keep it to yourself and share this video to help others. And stay tuned for the next video in the Decoded series."

        "transcription": "Mostly in engineering, in the halfway through, many students get to know, right? It's not their interest anymore. I need to do master's or PhD to get a good job. So that's why I think coding will pass me through that lane. My name is Kalpana Atmaji from Bihar, Chhattisgarh. Done my graduation in Electronics and Telecommunication Department. After college, there's not much of a good placement opportunity. In cryo, I guess I've started my journey in the month of October. By the month of July, I have placed. For me, the deciding factor is your tagline, learning by doing. So what I got to know about in the other courses, they're only teaching, that's it. Like college curriculum is there, but in the cryo, right? Right from the starting month, started doing the project. Whether it's a basic HTML, CSS website, or it's an advanced website. Since I'm very new into this, knowing how the software engineering stuff works, how things goes into productions, how to write a theme for everything. My main goal is to learn, to learn as much as I can in a span of time. And secondly, I guess, yes, placement is also one of my goals to get there. But yes, the learning is most important till the day one. The best is, I guess, is our mentor called Ejo John. So the thing is, he was telling us about don't get much into technicalities first. So just learn how the things work. Just get to know how the thing work first and then go into technicalities. So the example you have given, right? Just first learn all the alphabets first, right? Not directly towards the sentence and everything. Just got to know about how the basic thing works first. So that has helped me a lot in my programming journey also. I will suggest that don't hurry up, right? If you are learning something, if you are investing your time in something, don't be very impatient, right? Just don't be like that, right? Give some time or invest time or learn. The mentors are very helpful and I guess if you want to learn more, you can also do that. Mostly focus on building the project more, right? Rather than watching the videos, building the project more. Clear your doubts regularly. But most importantly, don't be impatient. Trust the process. Trust on yourself and I guess it will work for you."

So eventually I was very sure the second job I'm going to do will be the development role and I can create and code and get my dream complete as a developer. My name is Animesh Jaishmukh. I have done my BTech. I always had an interest in development and in second, third year itself, I did some courses, but they were not in depth, you know, things were different. That Cryo was doing, I mean, I feel like the resources that are available on internet are not very structured. Uh, like we will never know, okay, this much is enough and we will get into deep. And then there was no need to, and we'll waste our time as well. And there was not a structured way to learn things, what to learn after what not. And so I wanted that kind of mentorship, that kind of content from Cryo. That was the first and second was the placement support, because sometimes, uh, like, I mean, most of the people starting new don't have that kind of. work to like get instantly get into organization with the connections. So, you know, it is very difficult as a fresher to know which company is hiring and how we can get there because as we know, there are a lot of companies and we don't have access to all of them. Right? Like right now while working I do realize that function writing skills that we have right all the things that are a code should have it should be readable. It should be all like more modular and all the things that I was not aware about these things, but now I'm pretty confident with writing any function or any code. I can say that, you know, why doing this projects in cryo somehow unconsciously I adapt those skills and I was not even aware about it. Yeah, how a project is built. Basically, what is the flow of building things? What should be prioritized and what should be not and like whole journey of getting a problem trying to solve it. I solved it then good and well enough and if I stuck then team was there to you know, guide me mentors were actually good and they were trying to. you know, not make the classes one-sided and make it interactive. Give us a bigger picture about the industry and the skills that they are teaching. But everyone have this problem of wanting things instantly because of the, you know, society and the time we live in. We get things very quickly, but I feel like career and health requires time to build. Rushing things will always, you know, not, I mean it might work, but it's like it whatever you are going to achieve will not be that, you know, quality of learning. So I'll feel like it takes time to upskill yourself if you are changing the stream completely or the domain completely."

Just come back home and again, same thing. My name is Ayush Mishra. I was a permanent president of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.

Yeah, this is a line you have to learn this. Yeah, this is the interview. You have to sit in that they just tell how to clear that interview what all those things you can tackle and what all those difficulty you will face in that they just tell you the answer of that work how so that was the best thing I have ever seen like the way they are working for myself. I also recognize that and started working hard. All those things have paid successfully.

But if you just understand that what that particular line is saying and how I can remember this line for long period of time that is the benefit part because in both of the cases you are doing the hard work, but if you just put a little bit of steps into it, what your mentors or cry was saying to you, you would be much more beneficial and you don't. have to do that hard work multiple number of times. It would be hard but it would be beneficial."
